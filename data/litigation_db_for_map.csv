A formal recommendation authorizing the opening of negotiations with Australia was adopted by the Commission and forwarded to the Council for the EU (the “Council”). After Member States requested greater involvement in the negotiations with Australia, the Council approved negotiating directives which 1) required the Commission to “report in writing to the Council on the outcome of the negotiations after each negotiating session and, in any event, at least quarterly” and 2) laid out specific procedures for the negotiations, including allowing the Council or a special committee to establish detailed negotiating positions for the EU. The Commission brought an action to annul these sections of the negotiating directives on the basis that they exceeded the Council’s authority and encroached on the Commission’s power. The Advocate General issued an opinion finding that the Council is entitled to ask for regular reports on the negotiations process, but it may not unilaterally impose detailed procedures for the conduct of international negotiations. The Advocate General recommended that the Court annul the section of the negotiating directives requiring specific negotiating procedures.

The Franklin District Council refused consent for the project on the basis that would have an adverse visual effect on the landscape, local community and equestrian activities.  Proponents of the project cite reduction in emission of harmful greenhouse gases and a national need for sustainable and renewable energy sources as support for the project.  The court determined that the purpose of the Resource Management Act 1991 would be better served by granting the wind farm proposal.  The court found that the benefit of the wind farm proposal, when seen in a national context, outweighed the site-specific effects and the effects on the surrounding area.  The court also rejected the council’s argument that because the wind farm was relatively small, its climate change benefits were not relevant. ",,,,,

This required a number of resource consents, including a discharge permit.  Section 7(j) of the Resource Management Act of 1991 required consent authorities to have particular regard to “the benefits to be derived from the use and development of renewable energy.”  Section 70A prevented consent authorities from considering applications for discharge permits regarding the effects of climate change except to the extent that the use and development of renewable energy enables a reduction in the discharge of greenhouse gases.  The company argued that this exception only applied when the application involved the use of renewable energy.  The court disagreed, holding that the exception applied to all applications whether they made use of renewable or non-renewable energy.

The Hunter Environment Lobby objected to the proposal, notably on the ground that the extensions would have an important impact on climate change. Nevertheless, the project was approved by the Planning Minister in November 2010 and the Hunter Environment Lobby appealed. In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions. The Court thus affirmed the approval, but subject to certain conditions, including a condition which required the offset of any direct GHG emissions from the mine. This condition could be suspended if another law or regulation was introduced which would cover these emissions. 

Following this initial decision, the Australian Government introduced a carbon price, which was implemented through federal legislation.  In light of this new scheme, in a subsequent decision the Court held that it was valid for the Minister to decide that the condition on the mine relating to offsetting of direct emissions was no longer necessary.

The administrator refused to provide the information. The court found that while information on emissions allowance transactions is “environmental information” within the meaning of the Environmental Information Directive, the data could not be released because it had not reached the expiry of the five-year period and there were no overriding public interest served by the disclosure of such information which would outweigh the confidentiality of the information.

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Court of Appeal, 2011)",,,,,,,United Kingdom,GBR,Suits against Governments: Renewable Projects,,Renewables Obligation Order,,Challenge allocation of renewable energy subsidy claiming unfair and discriminatory,Dismissed,,,,,,Closed,,"Tate & Lyle requested judicial review of their allocation of 1.0 Renewables Obligations Certificates  (ROC) for the use of co-firing of biomass with combined heat power (CHP) arguing that they should have received 1.5 ROC. Prior to suit, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change had discovered an error in its prediction of costs of co-firing of biomass with CHP, but after assessment, determined that the original allocation was appropriate. Tate & Lyle alleged that the Secretary’s methodology in making this determination was unfair and discriminated against the technology. The High Court of Justice found that the government’s allocation was reasonable. 

On appeal, Tate & Lyle alleged that the Secretary should have only updated the cost information when recalculating its allocation. The Court of Appeals found that it was reasonable for the Secretary to incorporate updated data for other aspects of the calculation and dismissed the application.

Dosanjh  (Court of Appeal, 2014)",,,,,,,United Kingdom,GBR,Suits against Individuals: Other Suits,,Directive 2003/87/EC ,,Challenging criminal sentence for cheating the EU ETS,Court reduced the sentences.,,,,,,Closed,,"The defendants were involved in manipulation of the EU Emissions Trade Scheme, running companies that formed two artificial ‘trading chains’ through which the fraud was operated. They were convicted of the common law offense of conspiring to cheat the public revenue and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 15 years, 11 years and 9 years, respectively. The defendants appealed the sentences, arguing that (1) it was wrong in principle to pass a sentence which was longer than the maximum penalty available for the equivalent statutory offences or for the cognate common law offence of conspiracy to defraud; and (2) the sentence of 15 years was, on the facts of the case, manifestly excessive. 

The court stated that Parliament had deliberately not decided the offense of cheating the revenue. Parliament had left the offense of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue from statutory charge, both in existence and the penalty at large, because it is of particular seriousness. In assessing whether or not the sentences were manifestly excessive, the court looked at previous decisions of the court and the draft guideline from the Sentencing Council, and noted that: cheating the revenue is a major drain on the public purse, and the defendants’ actions were a serious level of offending, with an enormous amount of planning. However, the court determined that those sentences were too high and reduced the sentences to 13 years, 10 years and 8 years.

1009,,European Commission v. Council of the European Union (European Court of Justice 2016),,,,,,,European Union,EUR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This separation of powers case arose from a decision of the EU Council relating to negotiations that the EU Commission would undertake with Australia regarding possible linkage of those jurisdictions’ emissions trading schemes. The Council’s May 2013 decision set out procedures for the negotiation, detailed negotiating positions, and designated the Council’s Working Party on the Environment to assist the Commission throughout the negotiation. The Commission challenged that decision on the grounds that it amounted to the Council assuming authority not granted by the controlling EU treaties, chiefly article 218(2)–(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The EU Parliament and a number of member governments intervened in the case—the Parliament in support of the Commission, most of the national governments in support of the Council. The Court, acknowledging that this was a case of first impression but also the latest in a series of disputes over the scope of authority available to EU bodies, substantially agreed with the Commission and ordered the annulment of several portions of the Council’s May 2013 decision, thereby giving the Commission a freer hand in conducting negotiations with Australia.

The appellant argued that the effects of climate change on Kirabati, namely rising ocean levels and environmental degradation, are forcing citizens off the island. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify the appellant for refugee status because the applicant was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In addition to finding a lack of serious harm or serious violation of human rights were the appellant to return to Kirabati, the court also expressed concern about expanding the scope of the Refugee Convention and opening the door to millions of people who face hardship due to climate change.

The applicant appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. The applicant again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts’ conclusions, finding that the applicant did not qualify as a refugee under international human rights law. The Court noted, however, that its decision does not rule out the possibility “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could [] create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”

The Environment Court of New Zealand conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed wind farm and determined that the project did not comply with the Resource Management Act because the substantial adverse impacts on the natural landscape outweighed the positive factors, principally the large quantity of renewable energy. 

Meridian appealed the decision challenging the court’s use of cost-benefit analysis and consideration of alternative sites. The High Court of New Zealand allowed the appeal and remanded the case back to the Environment Court. While the High Court found that the Environment Court was permitted to use cost benefit analysis, it instructed the court to allow Meridian to give further information on alternatives and opportunity to present a market-based analysis of impacts. In addition, the High Court denied a cross-appeal alleging the court had erred in considering climate change impacts without first determining the extent to which climate change is caused by human activity. 

Before the Environment Court revisited the issue, Meridian announced that it had withdrawn its applications for resource consent.

The Federal Court of Australia summarily dismissed the appeal, finding that the appellant had no reasonable prospect of success because the laws did not effect or authorize the acquisition of the appellant’s property. On appeal, the Full Court upheld the dismissal.

The appellant appealed again to the High Court of Australia. The High Court found that the proceeding should not have been dismissed because the possibility remained that the laws are invalid due to the informal arrangement between the State and the Commonwealth

Macquarie appealed the court’s finding that it was subject to implied CO2 emissions limits.  The implicit conditions were based on common law principles that require prevention of emissions in excess of levels that could be achieved by exercising “reasonable regard and care for the interests of others and the environment.” The court of appeals reversed the lower court’s decision, reasoning that these common law principles only protected private rights (such as a nuisance claim) and were not applicable to a permit granted under a statute.

One of the principal issues related to potential flooding and the decision is the first to apply the State Coastal Planning Policy anticipating a 0.38 meter increase in sea level due to climate change. The Tribunal determined that the development application warranted conditional approval. With respect to potential flooding, the Tribunal found that the level of the water table over the lifetime of the development, including anticipated increase in the water table due to sea level rise by 2100, would not compromise the structural stability of the building or cause water ingress. Thus, the proposal did not warrant refusal because of potential for flooding. The development application was approved subject to 40 conditions including conditions to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate having regard to heritage and amenity considerations.

The support scheme provided direct income support to farmers, however it was amended such that all direct payments beyond a certain amount should be reduced by a certain percentage each year.  The savings made through these reductions would then be used to finance measures under the rural development policy, in light of the “new and demanding challenges” faced by the agriculture sector, “such as climate change and the increasing importance of bio-energy, as well as the need for better water management and more effective protection of biodiversity.”  The Preamble also noted that Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the EU and its member states are called upon to “adapt its policies in the light of climate change considerations.”
The Court reviewed two issues: (1) whether a new provision to the Regulation to reduce the amount of direct payments to farmers was valid, against an existing provision that already set the amount, in light of the principle of protecting legitimate expectations; (2) and whether a four percent increase for farmers with larger holdings exceeding 300,000 euros violates the principle of non-discrimination. The Court ruled that the purpose of the earlier provision was to establish support schemes for farmers, and that the decreases in direct payments, as well as the percentage of reductions were valid, and did not violate any applicable principles of EU law.

The Court, confirming an earlier decision of its advocate general, rejected the claim, holding that the EU has the right to permit a commercial activity, in this instance air transport, to be carried out in its territory only on the condition that operators comply with the criteria that have been established by the EU.  The court rejected the argument by the airlines that the ETS could not apply to flights that mostly take place outside of EU territory.  A 2008 Directive requires that, beginning January 1, 2012, all airlines flying into, out of, and within the EU possess enough carbon allowances to cover their greenhouse gas emissions.

In support of these allegations, it highlights that Pakistan’s government has acknowledged the reality and consequences of climate change with the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy of 2013. While the Petition alleges a variety of specific acts or omissions by Pakistan’s government, its chief focus is on the approval of a plan to develop coal fields located in the Thar desert region, located in the southeast corner of the country. That development is anticipated to increase Pakistani coal production from 4.5 to 60 million metric tons per year, with a commensurate increase in greenhouse gas emissions. It is also expected to displace residents in that region, and to lead to environmental degradation both directly (through water quality impacts) and indirectly (through air quality impacts from coal combustion).

Bord Na Móna Allen Peat Limited and others engaged in peat extraction and transport were also parties to the case.  At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EU’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plant’s operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plant’s feedstock. Edenderry and the other respondents countered that because neither the peat nor plant operations were contingent upon one another they were unrelated for the purposes of environmental review. The High Court, noting that it was required to base its decision on the “actual reality of the project” at issue, rejected Edenderry’s arguments as theoretical—the permit application, after all, contemplated sourcing from these particular bogs, such that any other approach would constitute a material change to the application. Thus, “[t]here is functional interdependence as the power plant relies for the vast majority of its raw material on the designated bogs.” The court also noted that it made no difference that the bogs were independently subject to an air pollution licensing regime. The planning authority, it explained, “is entitled to take the licenses into account” when assessing the impacts of the peat extraction operations.

As a result of a fraudulent sale to Winnington of EUAs belonging to Armstrong, it was necessary to determine, among other things, their status under law.  To determine the status of EUAs, the Court applied a three-part test identified in Re Celtic Extraction.  In order for EUAs to be considered property, there must be statutory framework conferring an entitlement on their holder to an exemption from a fine, the “property” must be transferable under a statutory framework, and the “property” must have value.  The Court classified EUAs as intangible property at common law, as they satisfy the three prongs of the test, and determined that since EUAs may be subject to restitutionary claims, Armstrong was entitled to a money judgment.

ACCC filed its claim on the basis that GM Holden had not shown any change in the way it manufactured Saab vehicles subsequent to its carbon neutral campaign and that GM Holden’s claim that 17 native trees would offset the carbon emissions was not proven and was misleading.  The Federal Court declared that GM Holden had breached sections 52 and 53(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974.  GM Holden agreed to advise its marketing staff to avoid “misleading and deceptive” marketing tactics and to plant 12,500 native trees to offset all the carbon emissions that would occur by Saab vehicles sold during the marketing campaign.

After weighing these considerations and concluding that the emissions reductions benefits were outweighed by “the significant harm that would be caused to the historic landscape and visual amenity of the common,” the administrative court dismissed the appeal.

The Billerud companies challenged the penalties arguing that since the failure was due to an internal error and the companies had a sufficient number of allowances at the time, they should be excused. The European Court of Justice (CJEU) found that under Directive 2003/87/EZ, penalties for failure to surrender credits still apply even if the entity held a sufficient number of allowances at that time. In addition, the CJEU found that the penalty was a lump sum and may not be varied by a national court on the basis of the principle of proportionality.

The Court also instructed the European Commission to revise its approach to determining how many free allowances to grant—a step that has injected uncertainty into the markets built on the ETS. Several features of the ETS are critical to the case: 

some allowances are auctioned to emitters and others are given away for free; 
there are a fixed proportion of free allowances, which are granted only to firms that face competition from non-EU firms—a category that excludes electricity generators;
the process for calculating the number of allowances—auctioned and free—begins with member states’ submission of emission sources and estimated volumes;
responding to members states’ overestimation of the allowances due to their industrial firms, the European Commission issued Decisions in 2011 and 2013 to govern the calculation of a “correction factor.”

The Court found that the European Commission’s 2013 Decision established a “correction factor” calculation that ignored relevant information, and on that basis instructed the Commission to revise its approach by March 2017. The Court’s ruling largely ratified the November 2015 recommendation issued in the case by Advocate General Kokott, but deviated in one important respect: whereas Kokott had concluded that too many free allowances were granted to the firms, the ECJ determined that it was unclear whether too many or too few had been granted.

The Planning Inspector affirmed the local council’s decision, citing the proposal’s adverse effects on surrounding landscapes and the residential amenities of nearby occupiers.  The Inspector acknowledged the importance of the need to combat global warming, but concluded that this policy goal must be balanced against visual and landscape concerns.  Even though the project would supply electricity to more than 1,200 homes and would generate significant revenues over its expected 25-year life span, these benefits, according to the Inspector, are outweighed by the unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the distinctive local landscape.

Nordzucker’s emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinery’s drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzucker’s emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinery’s drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operator’s emissions and additional allowances are surrendered. The European Court of Justice found that such penalties should not apply and that, in such cases, national authorities should establish proportionate penalties taking into account relevant factual circumstances.

The council sought an injunction from the court preventing the wall from being rebuilt, arguing that the council had a policy of planned retreat and that rebuilding the wall could cause damage to other properties, especially if it was built without the approval of the council. The Vaughan’s responded by bringing an action against the council, alleging breach by the council of the 2001 development consent.  The court upheld the council’s request and issued an injunction preventing the wall from being rebuilt. The two parties later came to a settlement before the final hearing allowing the Vaughan’s to rebuild the wall using geobags and sand as opposed to rocks, which they had initially planned to use.

Citizens objected to the proposal and appealed the Council’s decision to grant a permit for the building due to the fire risks associated with the proposal. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal relied upon the strong community need for the community hall but nevertheless recognized that a prudent approach was needed and that climate change predictions suggested that Victoria would experience more extreme fires in the future. Accordingly, the Tribunal dealt with the risk of loss of life with respect to bushfire risks by imposing conditions on the permit ensuring that the loss of life risks were reduced to a manageable level. To this respect, one interesting condition imposed by the Tribunal was that the community hall could not be occupied until an Emergency Management Plan had been prepared by the permit holder.

Subsequently, Barclays and Tricorona used information gained from their relationship with CFP to arrange for Barclays to acquire Tricorona. CFP brought suit against Barclays and Tricorona, seeking compensation for the defendants’ purported misuse of confidential information and breach of an exclusivity agreement. Based on evidence presented at trial, the court found that neither Barclays nor Tricorona owed an obligation of exclusivity to CFP at the relevant times. The court found, however, that CFP provided confidential information to Barclays and Tricorona regarding the value of Tricorona’s portfolio of CERs and that the defendants wrongfully used this information to their own advantage by arranging for Barclays to purchase Tricorona. The court held Barclays and Tricorona jointly liable for each other’s breaches of confidentiality and entered a judgment o f ten million pounds in compensatory damages.

On appeal, the Planning Inspector concluded that the contribution that 2,500 kW turbines would make to the national energy supply in achievement of national policies on renewable energy, though tangible, did not outweigh the serious harm the proposal would cause to the character and appearance of the surrounding landscape, particularly the Brow Moors, having regard to local planning policies.  The Inspector took particular note of the Moor’s importance in the national cultural history, due to their prominence in the writings of the Brontë family.

As the electrician did not have the appropriate accreditation to install the solar panels, the company was not entitled to claim Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (Cth).  The federal authority in charge of administering the issuance of RECs, the Clean Energy Regulator, sought civil penalties against the respondents for contravening the Act by providing false information as to the qualifications of the electrician. In discussing the factual background to the case, Justice Foster noted that a state government feed-in tariff offered for renewable energy projects had created significant market pressure for projects to be delivered quickly (the tariff was only available through 2016), and that there had been a shortage of qualified electricians to meet the demand.

The applicant argued that Metrolinx exceeded its jurisdiction in entering the supply contract for DMUs, as it failed to first conduct a feasibility study with respect to electrification of the air-rail link. Subsection 2(1) of the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. J.1 (the ""JRPA"") permits the court to exercise judicial review in circumstances where there has been an exercise or refusal to exercise a ""statutory power of decision"", defined as a decision deciding or prescribing the legal rights, powers, or privileges of a party. The court, rejecting the applicant’s argument, held that the preamble did not confer any legal right, and also pointed out that the EBR provides specific mechanisms to address environmental complaints, which do not include judicial review. The application for judicial review was accordingly dismissed.

The Companies claimed that the directive violated the principle of equality since it provided for a difference of treatment between certain industries.  Indeed it included the companies from the steel industry but excluded companies from the plastic and aluminum industries.  The French Conseil d’Etat referred the question to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.  The European Court of Justice held that the directive did not violate the principle of equality as the difference of treatment between the industries was justified by objective criteria, such as the very low carbon dioxide emissions from the non-steel industries.

The Court granted plaintiff’s request for an increase in the emission allowances for its combined cycle power plant in Huelva, which had been incorrectly considered a “new entrant” to the emissions market under the regulation’s timetable. Plaintiff’s request for an increase in its emission allowances as to its coal-fired power plant in La Coruña, one of the five worst emitters in the country¸ was denied. The Court found that the government was justified in applying the maximum penalty of 55% over the total 2000-2002 historical emissions for that category of emitter, despite the fact that plaintiff was thus allowed a lower emission factor than other emitters of the same generation of technologies.

Foraneto sought partial annulment of the Council’s decision in order to increase its credit allowance by a total of 35,318 tons, or 11,772 additional tons per year (the amount originally requested); in the alternative, they sought compensation at the average market rate.  The court found in Foraneto’s favor, holding that the assignment of credits was made by applying formalistic factors that did not take into account the real volume of production at the Tarragona facility.  Based on an expert’s testimony, the court changed the assignment to a total of 174,508 tons for the 2005-2007 period, or 58.136 tons per year.

Minera Catalana had requested the exclusion of the types of processes employed at its facility (the drying of barbotine, a mixture of clay and water, by atomization) in the definition of “combustion facilities” under Law 1/2005 of March 9th, as modified by Royal Decree 5/2005 of March 11th, which regulates the market for GHG emissions trading in Spain.

Court found that rules setting standards for SO2 emissions, and which took into account investments to reduce SO2 emissions by coal-fired power plants in assigning emission allowances under the Plan, were null and void on their face because they were not specifically authorized by Spain’s implementing statute for the EU’s Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003, Law 1/2005 of March 9th.  Rules relating to the provisional assignment of credits for new installations also found to be contrary to the implementing statute because they effectively altered the definition of “new entrants” in the statute.  However, the Court rejected plaintiff’s argument that the Plan’s methodology for the assignment of credits to coal-fired power plants was invalid because it placed undue burdens on certain facilities, as well as its argument that the allowance reserves for new entrants were inadequately low.
