It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above.

The Strategy identifies key climate risks for the country, such as glacial retreat and reduced access to the associated water resources, unusual variation of temperatures on land and in the sea, changing historical patterns of rainfall, rising sea levels, and the increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. It also assesses the distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Peruvian economy.

Based on the two above assessments, the ENCC sets two key objectives, each with 4 associated indicators :
<ol>
 	<li>Prevent the adverse impacts of climate change from reducing the vulnerability of the economy and society to such impacts, raising awareness among the population and implementing adaptation actions in appropriate scale. The associated indicators are:
<ol>
 	<li>Increased proportion of people who know what actions to take to manage climate change risks and adapt to the impacts</li>
 	<li>Increased volume of private investment and increased quality of public expenditure for climate change adaptation</li>
 	<li>Reduced human and economic losses due to the occurrence of natural  disasters linked to climate change</li>
 	<li>Increased production of scientific research and technological development as a basis and guide for climate change risk management and adaptation to climate change</li>

The law defines ""sustainable consumption"" as ""use of natural resources in order to provide quality of life for the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations"" (Art 1.1) and it includes among its nine key objectives the""promotion of reduction in consumption of water, energy and other renewable and non-renewable natural resources at the household level and from production, commerce and services"" (Art 2.II).

Other objectives include: promoting re-use of and recycling of packaging and products to reduce solid waste and hazardous waste (Art 2.III-IV); encouraging companies to incorporate social, cultural and environmental dimensions in their production and management processes and better management of the whole life cycle of products (Art 2.V-VI); and ensuring the right to information and promotion of environmental labeling and certification (Art 2.VIII).

To achieve these objectives, federal, state and municipal governments are called on to carry out public awareness and media campaigns and train teachers on including sustainable consumption in their curriculum for primary and secondary education (Art 3.I-II)."
"13th Five-Year Plan",2015,China,2033,CHN,Mitigation,Executive,2016,"16 March 2016","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation","The 13th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2016-2020 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. It gives top priority to economic development to reach a GDP growth rate of 6.5-7% per annum, consistent with the goal of becoming a 'moderately prosperous society' by 2020, guided by five key principles of “innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development”. At the same time, the 13th Five Year Plan sets peak targets for carbon emissions and energy and water consumption, as well as goals for increasing efficiency of industries and eliminating outdated or overcapacity production facilities, increasing energy production from renewables, and developing green infrastructure.

<strong>Carbon Emissions</strong>

China aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 18% from 2015 levels by 2020, in line with China’s pledge at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where President Xi Jinping affirmed China’s commitment to reduce total carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels by 2030 and peak carbon emissions by 2030.

The 13th Five-Year Plan also tasks the government with developing rules and regulations to manage the national carbon trading program to be developed based on expansion of the existing seven pilot schemes and expected to be launched around 2018.

<strong>Energy </strong>

China aims to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 15% from 2015 levels by 2020 (compared to the 16%  set in 12th Five-Year Plan 2011-2015, which eventually delivered a reduction of about 18.2%). This more conservative goal is consistent with the estimated 6.5%-7% GDP growth rate projected for 2016-2021, which is slower than the 7% growth rate targeted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. To reach this target, the 13th Five Year Plan specifies sectoral targets and milestones. First, it sets a further goal to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by at least an additional 3.4% in 2016. Second, it caps China’s total energy consumption at 5 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020, a 16.3% increase in consumption from 2015 levels.

To reach these goals, China's energy production mix is set to diversify and shift away from coal and towards greater proportion of renewables. China is increasing the efficiency of coal burning power plants and also plans to shut down coal-fired boilers that fail to meet national standards, and has restricted construction of new coal-fired power plants. The Plan also supports increase in renewable energy capacity and connection through national government support for wind, solar, and biomass energy production. The Government will also continue to invest in new hydropower, energy storage and nuclear power projects, as well as further increase in the network of smart grids and ultra high-voltage power transmission.

<strong>Transportation</strong>

The transportation measures and goals in the 13th Five Year Plan are closely related to addressing air pollution, in order to ""maintain acceptable air quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020"". The Plan aims to expand the electric vehicle market, by constructing dedicated parking lots and charging facilities, and removing almost 4 million high-emission vehicles from roads. The Plan will continue to support adoption of  low-emission ""new energy vehicles"" through subsidies to automakers, local governments for purchase of green fleets, and tax breaks and free registration for consumers.
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 8""></div>
<strong>REDD+ and LULUCF</strong>

The 13th Five Year Plan also aims to modernize commercial agriculture production to reduce overcapacity, while aiming to turn 1 million hectares of marginal cropland into forest or grassland. In an effort to reduce air pollution, the Plan also aims to increase forest coverage to 23.04% over the next five years."
"Royal Decree 900/2015 on Energy Self-Consumption",2015,Spain,2012,ESP,No,Executive,2015,"9 October 2015","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Royal Decree seeks to promote economically sustainable distributed generation and the use of renewable energies, but also introduces charges and tolls for grid access, with the goal of fair burden-sharing among electricity grid users.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are two self-consumption modalities:</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li>'supply with self-consumption'  - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li>
 	<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of &lt;50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid. This prohibits individual small self-consumers from receiving compensation for any self-generated and unused electricity, unless they register as electricity production businesses.</p>"
"Clean Power Plan",2015,"United States of America",2022,USA,No,Executive,2015,"1 August 2015 (Federal regulation to be adopted and reviewed by Court by June 2016)","Energy Supply","The Clean Power Plan, developed under the <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/clean-air-act/"">Clean Air Act</a>, sets state targets for carbon emissions reductions, and offers a flexible framework under which states may meet those targets. The aim is to reduce national electricity sector emissions by an estimated 32 % below 2005 levels by 2030 (nearly 870 million tons), in particular in two subcategories of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units: fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (mostly coal- and oil-fired power plants), and natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units.

Options for cutting emissions include investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, natural gas, and nuclear power, and shifting away from coal-fired power. The Plan also aims to limit shift to natural gas and promote renewables.

Targets differ across states because of each state’s unique mix of electricity-generation resources, as well as technological feasibilities, costs, and emissions reduction potentials. States are free to combine any of the options in a flexible manner to meet their targets or join together in multi-state or regional compacts to reduce their carbon emissions through the lowest cost options, including through emissions trading programs.

States must submit a final plan, or an initial plan with a request for an extension (potentially until September 2018), by September 6, 2016. Compliance period starts in 2022.

The Clean Power Plan also provides incentives for early deployment of renewables and efficiency measures benefiting low-income communities, as well as tools to assist states in implementing market-based approaches. A Federal Implementation Plan is also being designed, for EPA to use in states that do not adopt adequate individual implementation plans.

The Clean Power Plan is expected to contribute significant pollution reductions, potentially resulting in:
<ul>
 	<li>Climate-related benefits of $20 billion</li>
 	<li>Health benefits of $14-$34 billion</li>
 	<li>Net benefits of $26-$45 billion</li>

The Plan sets the new target for installed renewable capacity to 22 GW by 2030 (originally 12 GW), with the first 4.5 GW to be commissioned by 2020. Domestic demand is to be mainly satisfied through solar PV (13.5 GW), wind (5 GW) and concentrated solar power (2 GW), as well as biomass (1 GW), CHP (400 MW) and geothermal (15 MW). The Plan also targets up to 10 GW of installed renewable capacity for export. These new targets should allow Algeria to cover 27% of its power demand with renewables by 2020.

To support the development of renewables, the National Fund for Renewable Energies and CHP (FNERC) was created, funded primarily by a 1 per cent part of the oil tax. The Plan introduces a PPA scheme with 20-year feed-in tariffs for solar PV and wind power. Base tariffs will range between 12.75 - 15.94 DZD/kWh (around 0.12 - 0.15 USD/kWh) for solar PV projects; and between 10.48 - 13.10 DZD/kWh (around 0.10 - 0.12 USD/kWh ) for wind power projects, depending on the installed capacity (1 - 5 MW or over). Other renewable sources are to benefit from FNERC investment grants of up to 90 per cent of the investment cost.

In addition to promotion of renewables, the Plan aims to increase energy efficiency through a number of avenues:
<ul>
	<li>improvement of heat insulation of buildings;</li>
	<li>development of solar water heating; promotion of co-generation;</li>
	<li>developing solar cooling systems;</li>
	<li>converting simply cycle power plants to combined cycle power plants, where possible;</li>
	<li>desalinating brackish water using renewable energy;</li>

The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland’s target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozliczeń Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power).</p>

The support also covers the so-called ‘prosumers,’ who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar).

The law concerns the electricity sector, and is focused on ensuring its modernization and development.

Part IV of the law sets out general goals for promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, and for the use of renewables within the context of expanding rural electrification. 

The law states the government shall ensure the promotion and development of rural electrification nationwide, through connection to an interconnected network or through distributed generation. Within the general framework for increased electrification, priority is to be given to distributed generation from renewable sources (except when such sources are scarce, deficient or of high cost). The law allows for surplus electricity generated from renewable energy sources to be purchased by the transmission system operator or by local distributors.

The law says that the State will ensure the promotion and development of renewable energy through establishing regulation for conditions and mechanisms for research, development, production of equipment and project financing. The government may also establish an agency to promote and develop renewable energy as and when necessary. The law also requires any electricity utility operate to connect renewable energy sources to networks (with connect fees borne by the applicant), with the conditions, volume and price for purchase of energy by utilities to be fixed by decree.

The law calls for the implementation of energy efficiency measures in the industry, transportation, commercial and residential sectors, and allows for the government to establish regulation for the obligations, conditions and resources necessary to implement such measures."

"Document CONPES 3700, sets the Institutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions in Climate Change",2015,Colombia,1817,COL,No,Executive,2011,"14 July 2011","Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The main objective of CONPES 3700 is to outline a mechanism for institutional co-ordination to incorporate climate change into sectorial and territorial decision making, the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA).

CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.

The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision.

A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC)."

It includes a definition of climate change (“a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods”, page 3), adds the concept of ecosystem services and processes to the Act, and applies the precautionary principle to any decision made regarding the environment that may risk human health or threaten damage to the environment. It also specifies that any decision made under the terms of the Act must be guided by consideration of climate change adaptation and mitigation issues.

The Act requires that the director of the department responsible for the environment must include in their Environmental Registry a climate change database in joint co-ordination with the National Advisory Committee on Climate Change. It also requires that the National State of the Environment Report, published at least once every 10 years, must include a description of national climate change activities, impacts and issues. It requires that climatic considerations and issues be incorporated into any National Policy for the conservation, sustainable development and management of the environment. Further, it specifically identifies climate mitigation as a critical ecosystem service that may be provided by sites of national biodiversity significance and enables the Minister to make any regulations necessary to uphold Vanuatu’s obligations under the UNFCCC for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

It enables a proprietor of a lease (as registered under the Land Leases Act) to grant a forestry right over the land covered by the lease.

The definition of forestry right includes a carbon sequestration right which is defined as ‘a right conferred by agreement or otherwise to the legal, commercial or other benefit (whether present or future) of carbon sequestration by any existing or future tree or forest on the land’. The Act therefore establishes a separate property right that enables carbon rights to be decoupled from land rights (and thus provides for the allocation of carbon rights). However, while almost all land in Vanuatu is held under customary tenure, only approximately 9% is leased, with a further 90% unleased. Therefore the majority of landholders will not be able to exercise similar rights to forest carbon.

"Clean Air Act",2015,"United States of America",1777,USA,No,Legislative,1963,"17 December 1963","Energy Supply, Transportation, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to control air pollution on a national level. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contaminants that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare. 

Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:
– National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) – EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)
– State Implementation Plans (SIPs)
– New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)
– National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)

The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.

Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection.

The EPA’s 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect.

The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established, and the EPA is currently promulgating standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and has announced plans to regulate GHG emissions from additional stationary sources.

The RO places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to source a specified and annually increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources, or pay a penalty. The obligation for 2009/10 was 9.7%, rising to 15.4% by 2015/6.

Previously, one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) was issued for each MWh of eligible generation, regardless of technology. In 2009, reforms gave new generators joining the RO different numbers of ROCs, depending on the costs and potential for large-scale deployment. New projects in more expensive technologies like offshore wind now receive more support and those that are more economic, like landfill gas, receive less. 

Generators can sell their ROCs to electricity supply companies, which use them to demonstrate compliance with the Obligation. This enables generators to receive a premium on top of the sale of the electricity. In 2010, further changes included the RO being extended from its current end date of 2027 to 2037 for new projects, in order to provide greater long-term certainty for investors, and an increase in support for offshore wind projects meeting certain criteria.

There are six levels of the Code, with mandatory minimum standards for energy efficiency at each level. Level 1 represents a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the 2006 Building Regulations. Level 6 would be a completely zero-carbon home (heating, lighting, hot water and all appliances).

Improvements in the energy efficiency of new homes of more than 25% compared to 2006 regulations (Level 3 of the code) would probably require some form of low- or zero-carbon energy generation, either by individual buildings (eg dedicated solar water heating) or by whole developments sharing a source of low carbon generation (eg wind turbines)."
"National Environment Management Policy (NEMP)",2015,Uganda,1734,UGA,No,Executive,1995,1995,"Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The NEMP recognises that Uganda faces a number of environmental issues including: soil degradation, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, increasing pollution and environmentally related diseases. These problems are compounded by poverty, low amounts of environmental awareness and low levels of technology. The NEMP aims to address these issues by establishing a more comprehensive and integrated approach to environmental issues. 
The NEMP, therefore, creates a National Environment Management Authority, a legal framework for climate issues, an effective monitoring and evaluation system to track the effects of different policies on the environment, population and economy, attempts to promote a new sustainable conservation culture and, finally, to harmonise local and national policy efforts on environmental issues.

New units are only permitted when they replace existing units (a maximum of 10), whereby the older reactor must be permanently disabled and the new reactor needs to be built on an existing nuclear facility instead of a new location.

The laws reverse the phase-out of nuclear power production, repealing the Nuclear Phase-Out Act and the ban on new nuclear power facilities.

The purpose of the law is to allow old nuclear reactors to be replaced with newer, safer models. It also reflects the recent shift towards new carbon technologies as opposed to a stronger expansion of renewable energies classified as counting towards climate mitigation. The Swedish parliament approved the act under the condition that no direct or indirect public funding may be available for the new nuclear power reactors.

Parliament also stipulated that operators of nuclear facilities and the owners of nuclear power reactors carry unlimited liability in the event of a nuclear accident. Companies are required to hold insurance against third-party claims up to EUR1.2bn (USD1.51bn)."

Given that one third of emissions occur in the road-based transportation sector, the fossil fuel independent vehicle fleet is a key contribution to Sweden’s GHG emission reduction target. 

The key principle is to put a price on the GHG emissions emitted by the transportation sector and thus encouraging a move towards fossil fuel independent fuels as non-fossil fuel based vehicles are becoming cheaper than fossil fuel based vehicles. This is to be achieved through various policy instruments, measures, initiatives and incentives. 

These include carbon pricing (emission trading, energy and especially carbon taxes) in the transportation sector, increasing the dialogue between the government and the automotive cluster to strengthen its long-term competitiveness and promote greener fuel development and vehicle technology, extension of subsidies to establish filling stations for renewable fuels, increasing the share of biofuels in road transportation fuels via implementing the EU fuel quality directive (up to 10% share of biodiesel in the mixture), the requirement that the  sustainability criteria must be fulfilled if the biofuels are to count towards the 10% target of fuels from renewable energy sources by 2020; mandating of binding emission standards for automotive manufacturers at 120gCO2/km for new passenger cars, which will be gradually reduced to 95gCO2/km in 2020; exploring the potential for the use of biogas (e.g. from waste) as transportation fuel, i.e. the development of 2nd generation biofuel via financial support (SEK875m USD118.4m) for biofuel demo-plants and the commercialisation of new energy technology; research and development initiatives to assess the incentives for the emerging electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids market, including appropriate stimulus and raising public awareness via consumer information on vehicle fuel consumption."

The main aim of the Act is to contribute to an adequate energy supply – i.e. diversified, safe, economical and compatible with the requirements of environmental protection. Its principal goals include:
- ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection
- promote the efficient and rational use of energy
- encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy.
The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders:
- The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM).
- The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000
- Households’ final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009).
Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.

The Energy Ordinance specifies the provisions of the Energy Act:
It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006. The overall funding for available feed-in tariffs is capped in 2015 at approximately CHF580m (USD605.9m), with funds to be distributed among the different types of technologies so as to ensure their parallel development (the entire fund cannot assigned to one single technology)."

The first phase of the trading scheme is due to start in 2015, covering companies that emit 125,000 metric tonnes or more of CO2 a year and factories, buildings and livestock farms that produce at least 25,000 tonnes of the gas annually. 

The basic plan for the emissions rights trading system shall be established every 5 years for a unit period of 10 years. An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.

The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2. 

The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.

The Minister of Environment is responsible for controlling and operating the ETS. It operates the quota evaluation commission and the emissions certification committee, and encourages the participation of relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Minister of Strategy and Finance must set up the plan so that influential factors such as commodity price are taken into account. 

During the first phase of the ETS (2015-2017), liable entities will be allocated 100% of their emissions permits for free based on their average emissions. Therefore demand for units will only be generated by entities exceeding their predicted emission levels. This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction. 

Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG. The specific criteria and procedures for the approval and certification of international offsets are yet to be established.

The government agency in charge can receive applications from qualified organisations and may select the emissions trading system's exchange among them through the evaluation of the Committee on Green Growth. In order to stabilise the market at an initial stage, companies will be subject to quota assignment through Phases I and II. When necessary, the government agency in charge, through the quota committee, will take measures to stabilise the market: adding up to 25% of the allowance reserve, specifying the minimum and maximum of emissions rights to be held, restricting borrowing and carry-over, and restricting the limit of offset emissions right's offers.

Financial support measures are allowed to industries whose competitiveness is negatively affected by the scheme. Financial and taxation incentives or subsidies can be provided for GHG reduction, technological development and distribution projects in relation to new and renewable energy."

It seeks to transform Rwanda into a middle-income country by the year 2020. This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).

The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).

Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.

To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020. To ease the pressure on wood biomass seeing that 86.3% of the Rwandan population uses wood as the source of energy, Vision 2020 targets to drop the use of wood energy in national energy balance, to 50% by 2020 through diversification of energy sources availed to the population."

RA 10121 provides a comprehensive, all-hazard, multi-sectoral, inter-agency, and community-based approach to disaster risk management through the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework. 

A National Disaster Risk Management Plan (NDRMP) is being formulated, developed, and implemented as the master plan that will provide the strategies, organisation, tasks of concerned agencies and local government units, and other guidelines in dealing with disasters or emergencies. Through this plan, a coherent, integrated, efficient, and responsive disaster risk management at all levels will hopefully be achieved.

The law also promotes the development of capacities in disaster management at the individual, organisational, and institutional levels. A very important feature of this law is its call for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in physical and land-use planning, budget, infrastructure, education, health, environment, housing, and other sectors.

RA 10121 also recognises local risk patterns and trends and decentralisation of resources and responsibilities and thus encourages the participation of NGOs, private sectors, community-based organisations, and community members in disaster management. It inhibits the full participation of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities in governance. The approach tends to be “response-oriented” or “reactive.” This is evidenced by the widespread emphasis on post-disaster relief and short-term preparedness, such as forecasting and evacuation, rather than on mitigation and post- disaster support for economic recovery.

Moreover, the Act mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in every province, city and municipality, and a Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC) in every barangay. 

The Strategic National Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for 2009-2019 aims to enhance the capacities of Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils.

The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges:  Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding.
The three core programme areas addressed are:
 Economic: Sustainable trade, Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Consumption
 Environment: Natural capital and Biodiversity
 Social: Social protection, poverty alleviation and equal opportunity/human development.

The strategic goals of the programme are to:
– Promote green investment and green jobs
– Improve eco-efficiency by changing production and consumption systems 
– Internalisation of environmental costs into pricing
– Develop sustainable infrastructure focusing on transportation and communication
– Develop demand for sustainable consumption among consumers through awareness raising 
– Account for depletion of natural resources in national accounts
– Promote efficient use of energy and water, including through improved watershed management and reforestation
– Improve biodiversity management and increase forest cover; prepare lists of endangered species
– Deliver basic services of acceptably high quality to all citizens. These would cover 10 years of schooling, healthcare, food, water, shelter and energy
– Ensure preparedness for natural and human-made calamity and emergencies through mitigation and integration of disaster contingencies in broader development strategies."

In 2011, the government presented the latest version of the Energy Report, which outlined the ambition to become more sustainable in energy and less dependent on fossil fuels in the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050.

As presented in this report, the three pillars of the Dutch energy strategy are to ensure reliable energy supply at competitive prices and green growth as primary economic objectives, while maintaining an international approach in the long-term transition to a sustainable energy supply.

To expand the share of renewable energy, the government proposes a two-track policy. The long-term approach aims to make renewable energy competitive with grey energy. The short term approach aims to achieve the European target for renewable energy in the Netherlands of 14% in 2020. This target should be achieved by using for instruments: Sustainable Energy Incentive Scheme Plus (SDE+); obligation for use of biofuels in the transport sector; co-firing with biomass in coal-fired power stations; and import of renewable energy.

The document sees the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) as the most important instrument for reducing carbon emissions. It acknowledges the need to improve the investment climate by reducing the regulatory burden and by facilitating more efficient control. This will involve an evaluation into the Electricity Act 1998 and the Gas Act, to assess the scope for deregulation, reduction of control costs and the administrative burden and the costs associated with compliance.

By establishing this market, producers and suppliers of electricity were able to offer electricity on a market.

The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.

The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the “1996=2000 principle” stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.

As of 1 April 2014, the regulation for the feed-in tariff (SDE+) for 2014 has opened. This regulation includes the following features: a budget ceiling is established for all types of renewable energy such as wind, geothermal, solar photovoltaic, biomass and hydro phased opening a ‘free category’ to enhance investments in certain technologies; feed-in tariff granted for a certain period (5, 12 or 15 years); a maximum subsidy amount for the Netherlands, to be determined annually (EUR3.5bn, USD5.4bn in 2014).

Since its introduction in 1998 several amendments have been made to incorporate new elements such as the transposition of EU Directives. Several changes have been introduced in the E- Act in 2010, such as smart metering and congestion management rules for electricity) in order to improve the Dutch energy market. The Electricity Act 1998 is currently being amended.

The law was a necessary step in order to realise the reduction in GHG emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy (defined as solar, wind hydropower, biomass, and geothermal energy) consumed relative to fossil fuels. The law does not, however, specify a percentage share of renewable energy.

The text lays the legal framework to develop national and regional programmes to exploit renewable energy, establish norms associated with renewable energy production, and issue permits for new projects and plants. This regulatory authority will rest in a government-authorised body (of the executive branch) in charge of all renewable energy programmes.

At the regional and local levels, the Authority both authorises local executive authorities to participate in the planning and approval of local and regional projects to develop renewable energy up to 25MW and obliges them to reserve and allocate local lands to said projects, within the framework of the law.

Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of “service payments” associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy.

This law codifies the requirement that by 2024 5% of Kazakhstan’s total energy consumption must come from renewable sources.

"Name of law The Natural Resources Conservation Authority (Air Quality) Regulations",2015,Jamaica,1407,JAM,No,Legislative,2002,2002,"Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","Regulates the emissions of particulates and substances deleterious to human health. This includes the licensing of premises and plants which produce such polluting substance; fees for discharge; and inspection.

The Natural Resources Conservation Authority Act enabled the implementation of the Air Quality Regulations and these regulations legislate for the licensing, monitoring, and collection of fees for emissions. These emissions specifically include the term GHGs, and name these. The regulations seem to refer only to industrial sources, specifying facilities and stack emissions. The implication of these regulations is that industrial emissions will be licensed, monitored and have fees levied against them.   

Every owner of a major facility must apply for an air pollutant discharge licence and licensees must submit emissions reports for each calendar year.  This report should contain estimates of the emissions for the year, based on the following details:
• Continuous emission monitoring data 
• Calculation of SO2 emissions based on fuel use and sulphur content data (combustion processes in which exhaust gases do not come in contact with products)
• Most recent and representative stack monitoring measurements conducted in the previous five years and activity data for the year for which emissions are estimated 
• AP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and activity data for the year 
• AP42 emission factor or equivalent methods and plant capacity data
• Mass balance (including fuel use data) based on the two previous years or the most recent representative year 
• Other approved methods supported by calculation and documentation

Further, the Regulations impose Discharge Fees on Licensees. Crucially, these fees are waived for emissions derived from the burning of renewable fuels, such as landfill gas and agricultural waste.

Where the regulations are not adhered to, sanctions may be applied to the licence holder. The management Authority  (individual or body authorised under the regulations) may then:
• Issue a control order 
• Impose administrative penalties
• Suspend or revoke any licence
• Refuse an application for renewal of any licence
• Apply to the Supreme Court for an injunction to prohibit the operation of the facility or any source at the facility

The regulations also mandate the development of a National Emissions Inventory to track air quality, which should be made available to the public and reported to the House of Representatives at least once every three years.

It was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock with a purpose of promoting effective and rational use of energy. It covers the following sectors: energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances. The subjects of the Law are factories and workplaces that consume more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent energy annually. Among factories, there are two categories: Factory I that uses more than 3,000kL equivalent; and Factory II that uses between 1,500-3,000kL equivalent.

The law states that to achieve the objectives the government will focus on:
• Increasing investment in renewable energy extraction, thereby increasing the proportion of renewables in the energy mix
• Working towards sustainable development through environment-friendly energy extraction
• Pursuing rational and efficient energy extraction

The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is in charge of enacting the law, and a first order of business was the identification of geographic areas for renewable energy exploitation. These areas, co-ordinated with the Ministry’s Energy Master Plan, will be prioritised for development in a Land Use List, approved by the Council of Ministers. Areas identified for exploitation that are “treasury land” (owned by the state) shall be allocated to renewable energy projects. Lands owned by individuals shall be purchased based on existing legislative authority, if approved by the Council of Ministers.

In addition to hosting a competitive bidding processes to develop projects on lands prioritised on the Land Use List, individuals or projects may approach the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources with a specific proposal to develop an extraction site on any lands in the country (already identified on the Land Use List or not) which have not already been allocated by a public tender. The law outlines the requirements for such proposals and a general outline for the decision making process.

The law specifies the purchasing arrangements of the electricity from bulk suppliers; much of this framework is pre-existing in the General Electricity Law.

Under the renewable energy law, individual homes may also produce their own renewable electricity, and sell any surplus energy back to the grid, with the price set by the purchase tariff specified in the Bulk Supply Licensees or the Retail Supply Licensees.

This law establishes the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund, which shall be administratively and financially independent. The Fund is overseen by the Board of Directors of the Fund, composed of the vice-chairman of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources; the secretaries-general of the Ministries of Environment, Planning and International Co-operation, and Finance; a commissioner nominated by the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Commission, and three representatives of the private sector appointed by the Council of Ministers.

The Strategic Framework underpinning the policy addresses both the supply and demand energy issues Jamaica faces. It prioritises seven key areas:
• Security of energy supply through diversification of fuels as well as development of renewable energy sources
• Modernising the country’s energy infrastructure
• Development of renewable energy sources
• Conservation and efficiency in energy use
• Development of a comprehensive governance/regulatory framework for the energy sector
• Enabling government ministries and agencies to be models/best practice for the rest of society in terms of energy management
• Eco-efficiency in industries

Finding environmentally sustainable energy solutions is central to the document. It seeks to facilitate cultural, institutional and technological change in a way that supports “aggressive” advances in energy efficiency and conservation, minimises greenhouse emissions and ulti¬mately provides green growth. These energy efficiency and conservation goals are seen as “no regrets” mitigation actions that can have positive impacts on society and the economy, principally by reducing costs and dependency on fossil fuel imports.

Among stated goals of the policy is that Jamaica realises its energy resource potential through the development of renewable energy sources and enhances its international competitiveness and energy security while reducing its carbon footprint.

Five sub-policies exist to support the National Energy Policy, namely:
• A Carbon Emissions Trading Policy developed to address Jamaica’s participation in the Clean Development Mechanism
• National Renewable Energy Policy 2010–2030

It regulates the restructuration of feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic plants (capacity > 200 kW). Starting from 1st January 2015, the feed-in-tariffs are to be paid based on one of the following three options, to be selected by the owner of the plant:
a) Current feed-in-tariffs will be reduced depending on the actual remaining period of life of the plant (from 25% for 12 years remaining to 17% for more than 19 years remaining) and distributed over a period of 24 years starting from the grid connection date instead of 20 years 
b) The fixed reduction of feed-in-tariffs, when the owner of the plant can opt for a reduction of the current feed-in-tariffs by a fixed percentage over the 20-year period (same as before). The Law now provides for the following different percentages, depending on the nominal capacity of the plant:
• 6% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 200 - 500kW;
• 7% for plants with nominal capacity with nominal capacity of 500 -  900kW;
• 8% for plants with nominal capacity above 900 kW.
c) The variable restructuration of feed-in-tariffs, which provides for current feed-in-tariffs to be reduced initially by a certain percentage and increased, by the same amount, at a later stage. The aim of introducing such option is to ensure annual savings of EUR600m (USD753m) over 2015-2019. 

In addition, the Law provides that owners can sell up to 80% of their expected future feed-in-tariffs to a third investor (selected among European leading financial operators through competitive tenders).

The results expected by 2020 are:
• Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).
• Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources.
• Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).
• GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.
• Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).
• Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.
To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:
• Fostering Energy Efficiency
• Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices
• Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive
• Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production
• Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level 
• Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection
• Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient
• Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system
The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:
• The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical
• The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure
• A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport
• The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario

• To maximize the efficiency of the transport network
• To reduce reliance on fossil fuels
• To reduce transport emissions
• To improve accessibility to transport

In order to achieve these goals and ultimately ensure that sustainable travel and transport is in place by 2020, the following key targets are proposed:
• Future population and employment growth will take place predominantly in sustainable compact forms, which would reduce the need to travel for employment and services
• 500,000 more people will make alternative means to commute and total share of car commuting will drop from 65% to 45%
• Support and provide alternative methods such as walking, cycling and public transport, to rise the share to 55% of total commuter journeys to work
• Total kilometres travelled by the car fleets in 2020 will not increase significantly from current levels
• Reduction of GHG emission from transport sector will be achieved compared to the 2005 level

Following these objectives and targets, following key actions are proposed:
• Reduce distance travelled by private cars and encourage smarter travel (e.g. encourage people to live close to workplaces, use pricing mechanisms or fiscal measures to encourage behavioural changes)
• Ensure alternatives to the car are more widely available, mainly through radically improved public transport service and through investment in cycling and walking.
• Improve the fuel efficiency of motorised transport through improved fleet structure, energy efficient driving and alternative technologies.
• Strengthen institutional arrangements to deliver the targets.

A key element was a government-sponsored programme of subsidies administered jointly by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Investment Centre in the Ministry of Economy, aimed at encouraging investments in energy efficiency and GHG reduction projects and at advancing new Israeli technologies. The Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Economy grants additional assistance (ILS40 million, USD10.4 million) to approved projects, based on new Israeli technologies (first installation).

Key elements of the National Plan included:
• Reducing residential energy consumption -  (responsibility of Ministry of Energy and Water Resources)
• Support for investments in GHG emissions reductions (responsibility of Ministry of Environmental Protection)
• Support for Israeli technologies and green innovation (responsibility of Ministry of Economy)
• Pilot projects  for green building and green building teaching and training  (responsibility of Ministry of Environmental Protection)
• Pilot project for retrofits ((responsibility of Ministry of Construction and Housing)
• Education and awareness (responsibility of Ministries of Environmental Protection and Transportation)
• Promotion of energy efficiency (responsibility of Ministries of Environmental Protection and Economy)
• Setting standards for energy efficiency (responsibility of Ministry of Energy and Water Resources)
• Transportation (responsibility of Transportation Ministry) – including energy efficient components in imported cars and eco-driving education

The approved budget for the implementation of the plan was ILS2.2 billion (USD573 million) until 2020. During 2011-2012 ILS106 million (USD27.6 million) were allocated to 208 projects, with a reduction potential of ~ 450,000 tons of CO2eq per year and a savings potential of approximately ILS100 million (USD26 million) per year in electricity and fuel costs.

General objectives and priorities of the period between 2008 and 2025 are set, and the strategy is to be implemented by the National Climate Change Program (NCCP).

The NCCS is structured as following: framework for the elaboration of the climate strategy; mitigation of climate change; adaptation to the changing climate; and implementation of the strategy. The reduction target for 2025 is reduction by 16% to 25% from the 1990 level in case of a unilateral 20% reduction by the EU, or 27% to 34% from the 1990 level in case of a conditional target reduction of 30% by the EU. The implementation phase first addresses adoption of a National Climate Change Programme (NCCP) for a two-year period. Monitoring is applicable to NCCS and also the NCCP, which is to be prepared by a set of indexes that reflect the climate change efficiency of the economy or the carbon reduction (e.g. GHG emission per GDP, emission per capita, energy intensity).

The NCCS identifies three major directions of actions for the long term climate change policy: to comply with EU and international requirements in order to reduce GHG emissions by reducing overall energy use; to fight against the unfavourable ecological and socio-economic effects of the inevitable climate change and improve adaptability to climate change impacts; and to raise social awareness of climate change. The government prepares annual reports on the progress of implementation of the NCCS to Parliament.

"National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for 2010-2020",2015,Hungary,1295,HUN,No,Executive,2010,"December 2010","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation","This action plan constitutes the basis for action on resource efficiency and sustainability. The strategic objective of the EU stipulates a 13% increase in renewable energy capacity by 2020. The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005.

The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport.

The NREAP provides that the following will be financed: green economy development, research and development, adaptation to use of green electricity, biofuel benefits, tariffs and tax issues. It also aims to formulate incentives through regulatory and comprehensive programmes on sustainable energy management, renewable energy, simplification of authorisation procedures, establishment of regional energy agencies, and review of energy certification procedures for buildings. Social measures such as employment, national and regional training, social awareness-raising and network of energy experts are among the planned measures outlined in the action plan. Specific laws and programmes in question and associated details are included at the end of the NREAP.

The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) holds the exclusive rights for the production, transfer and distribution of electricity throughout the country. However, the Minister of the relevant department (now the MEECC) can authorise individual producers (natural or legal entities) to produce electricity at power stations which belong to them (as opposed to those which belong to the PPC), introducing thus for the first time an element of energy market liberalisation, applicable for the generation of electricity for installations up to 50MW. These natural or legal entities can either produce electricity for personal use (self-producers) or they can sell it to the PPC (independent producers). 

Individual energy producers can use renewable sources, such as wind power, solar power, biomass, geothermal resources and hydropower. Addressing energy consumption, the legislation adopted a fixed feed-in price for renewables of roughly 90% of the household electricity rate.

"National Energy Policy",2015,Grenada,1280,GRD,No,Executive,2011,"November 2011","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","Grenada’s National Energy Policy (GNEP) lays down the Government’s objectives for shaping the energy sector in Grenada, in order to “ensure access to affordable, equitable, and reliable energy sources and services to drive and secure national development, and to improve the quality of life for all of its citizens”. 
The GNEP is based on seven core principles:
• Energy Security;
• Energy Independence;
• Energy Efficiency;
• Energy Conservation;
•  Environmental Sustainability;
•  Sustainable Resource Exploitation;
•  Rational Energy Prices; and
•  Energy Equity and Solidarity, including with future generations. 

The GNEP further calls for a minimum of a 20% reduction of GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion below ‘Business As Usual’ by 2020, and it sets a specific target for renewable energy: to provide 20% of all domestic energy used for electricity and transport by 2020.  It also calls for the implementation of various measures to encourage energy efficiency and conservation in energy generation, transport and buildings sectors —although it does not include specific targets. 

In particular, the GNEP calls for a set of specific projects to be co-ordinated by the Government by 2020:
• Complete feasibility and construct a 20MW geothermal plant
• Construct an additional 20MW geothermal plant
• Construct a 2.5MW wind turbine for Carriacou
• Achieve 10% electricity generation by wind & solar PV
• Establish vehicle fuel efficiency standards
• Achieve 20% market penetration with hybrid and electric vehicles.

It also demands the establishment of the necessary international structures, including a National Energy Commission representing relevant stakeholders that would “review the achievement of the policy targets, receive comments from stakeholders (…) and feed this information back to government, recommending solutions where necessary”.
 
Finally, it offers a layout of a 10-year Grenada Energy Development Strategy (2010-2020), which provides for adoption of energy specific legislation such as Energy Efficiency Act, Geothermal Bill, and revision of the Electricity Supply Act. The proposed Energy Efficiency Act includes the following provisions:
• Mandate commercial building planning regulations(e.g. mandatory renewable sources contribution to energy consumption for new buildings);
• Require the use of energy efficiency standards and building codes for ventilation, cooling, water- and process-heating, lighting and in institutional, commercial and industrial buildings;
• Require all government buildings of a certain size to have periodic energy audits and compliance audits;
• Mandate the compilation and publication of sectoral benchmarking data (e.g., kWh per hotel room-night for the hotels sector);
• Require commercial banks to provide financial incentives for investments in energy efficiency to businesses and homeowners;
• Mandate specified fuel efficiencies for imported vehicles;
• Require training in ’eco–driving’ practices for public and private sector organisations;
• Develop, monitor, publish and update indicators of national energy consumption and efficiency.

As of August 2014, the government had not passed legislation to make the measures outlined in the GNEP legally binding, but it is currently drafting a concession law for the exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources.

The law intends to contribute to an increase in electricity generation from CHP by 25% by 2020 through the modernisation of existing and construction of new CHP plants.

It replaces a 2000 law on CHP. Both laws are primarily intended to promote large CHP plants affected by decreasing electricity prices as a consequence of liberalisation. At the same time the share of CHP-produced electricity was to increase to lower CO2 emissions by 23m tonnes by 2010. Half of this target is to be achieved by the CHP law, the other half by a voluntary agreement with industry. Renewable energy technologies not covered by the EEG may benefit from this law, including co-firing of biomass in fossil-fuelled power plants and biomass-fired CHP larger than 20MW. The premium cannot be combined with other support, particularly not with the EEG.

In the original (2002) act, only the CHP share of the quantity of electricity produced was subsidised, which was fed into the grid at all voltage levels for general supply. With effect from 1 January 2009, CHP electricity that is fed into non-public grids or is used for self-supply is also subsidised. Subsidies for new heat networks or expanding heat networks were also included. 

The 2009 amendment aims to increase electricity generation from CHP plants by promoting the modernisation and construction of CHP plants, support for the fuel cell sector and the funding for the construction and expansion of heating and cooling systems, and the construction and extension of heat and cold storage capacity. With the amendments in 2008 and 2009, the percentage share of high-efficiency CHP plants in electricity and heat generation (primary energy use over 90%) will be increased from 12% to 25%.

The instrumental core of the former Electricity Grid Feed Act has been retained: grid operators must feed renewables-generated electricity into the grid and charge a state-prescribed price for it. However, the regulatory approach has been updated and made more sophisticated under the new Act. The Act aims to generate 35% of electricity supply from renewable energy resources by 2020 (amended from 30% after the Fukushima disaster).

The general objective of the Policy is to reverse environ¬mental degradation and reduce vulnerability to climate change. 

The policy follows six lines of action that will be prioritised by the national government: 
• Restoration of damaged ecosystems and landscapes; 
• Integral environmental sanitation; 
• Integrated management of water resources; 
• Integration of environmental policy and priorities into the general governance of the national territory; 
• Environmental responsibilities and compliance; and
• Adaptation and risk reduction in relation to climate change.

One of the major mandates of the policy is that each ministry must incorporate environmental concerns into their own policies and participate in an inter-ministerial environmental council co-ordinated by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. This council will assist in the creation of an “action plan” that will lay out implementation plans for the tasks and responsibilities set out in the National Environmental Policy corresponding to each of the lines of action listed above.

Adaptation is specifically prioritised along with reduction of environmental risks. The Policy calls for the development of a National Adaptation Plan that should include mechanisms to monitor and evaluate climate change and the risks it poses; projects to improve water management, especially in relation to flooding during the rainy season and droughts during the dry season; incorporation of adaptation into urban planning and housing designs; evaluation of epidemiological monitoring and public health systems in relation to specific health risks caused by climate change; promotion of environ¬mental concerns and climate change within the national education curriculum; promotion of renewable energy; funding priorities and plans to take advantage of international financing schemes.

The Ministry for Natural Resources and Energy is responsible for the implementation, monitoring the “National Programme for the Rational Use of Energy”. To promote this objective, the law establishes the obligation to execute energy efficiency programmes of rational use of energy in companies with high consumption levels. Companies have the legal obligation to report the precise amount of energy they use. When the amount is beyond the maximum level allowed by the Ministry, businesses are notified and have three months to submit a plan to reduce their energy consumption, within six months. The government can, in certain circumstances, provide specific technical recommendations to these companies.

The Law calls for the creation of campaigns to raise public awareness on the rational use of energy, including educational programmes in schools. All products must publicly announce their level of energy consumption.

Producers of machines and/or vehicles that use energy (of any source) must obtain authorisation from the Ministry relating to their energy efficiency before beginning production of these goods. The import of similar equipment (including vehicles) is conditional on the submission of energy efficiency data. 

The law determines that the Ministry for Natural Resources, Energy and Mining is in charge of determining limits for emissions from vehicles, to be monitored and controlled by the Ministry of Transport.

Additionally, it exempts equipment used for renewable energy from import duties and provides for other tax exemptions (excise tax, ad valorem tax, general sales tax, specific customs tax). Fines and penalties apply upon breaching the law.

Additional legislative and executive regulation specifies mechanisms of support for clean technologies and rational use of energy. Those include an Executive Decree reforming the incentives system for the use of hybrid electrical vehicles; a modification of the law to provide tax exemption for equipment and certain materials, imported as well as produced domestically that contribute to energy savings and rational use; a decree that establishes new rules of the ‘Bandera Azul Ecológica’  certification programme for climate-friendly communities and private housing (energy efficiency, low GHG emissions, etc.); and a directive that requires the energy and telecommunications sectors to adopt administrative, financial, legal and technical measures  to ensure citizens’ access to cleaner energies at the least possible cost.

The Law seeks to promote efficient energy management, which comprises both energy efficiency and demand response. 

The Law establishes the legal framework and mechanisms to promote the use of non-conventional energy sources, and to foster investment, research and development of clean energy technologies. It seeks to set lines of action to comply with commitments made with regard to renewable energy, efficient energy management and GHG reduction, such as those acquired by approving the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 
The Law allows the release of surplus energy into the network for all self-generators. Surplus energy of small self-generators that use FNCER is recognised as energy credits, which can be negotiated according to regulations issued by the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission. The Law introduces a new classification for self-generators: small and large scale, but only in reference to the form of energy delivery that is classified as small scale by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit.

This Law also signals spot energy prices to domestic demand, guaranteeing the participation of end-users in the electricity market, as they have the opportunity to make decisions according to the consumer price signal observed, particularly during peak hours. 

Distributed generation is also an important modification of the electricity sector. The new Law allows a generator close to consumption centres and connected to a Local Distribution System to deliver energy directly to consumers.

Incentives for FNCER include those related to: (i) tax, through deductions on the investment income statement related to these purposes; (ii) tariffs, through the exemption from payment of import duties on machinery and equipment for this type of generation; and (iii) accounting, where an accelerated depreciation on assets is permitted.

The Law provides for the establishment of a Non-Conventional Energy and Efficient Energy Management Fund (FENOGE), which may finance all or part of the programmes and projects for the residential sector, at levels 1, 2 and 3, as long as they involve small scale, self-generation solutions and promote energy efficiency and good practice.

UPME and CREG are responsible for issuing regulations applicable to FNCER, establishing new self-generation schemes, and setting price signals. The Law provides the government 12 months to issue such regulations.

It foresees the identification of a GHG emissions baseline and the formulation and implementation of low-carbon development plans for the sectors of energy, mining, agriculture, transportation, industry, waste and construction. On the basis of these results appropriate NAMAs and projects will be put in place. With the support of the EU, the UK and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, UNDP will contribute to the implementation of the Strategy by providing information for the development of emissions baselines and of cost-effective action plans and public policies. It will also strengthen the capacity of the ministries to integrate low-carbon aspects into their activities.

The LCDS seeks to explore ways in which Colombia can contribute to the challenge of mitigating global climate change, while adapting to the impacts of changing climatic conditions domestically. Colombia sees potential co-benefits in terms of the LCDS contributing to economic, social and environmental goals. For instance, in terms of economic competitiveness it sees potential gains by increasing energy efficiency and hence production costs. Planning documents publicly available on the LCDS refer to the development of working groups to examine the potential mitigation and adaptation benefits in each sector of the economy, in addition to production of sector-specific abatement curves.

It sets out a framework to manage and control toxic substances released from all stages of economic activities: from development, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, storage, use up to disposal. 

This law is administered by the Environment Canada and to assess toxicity of substances or to develop associated regulations, objectives, guidelines and codes of practice the Ministry collaborates with the Health Canada. Among the list of toxic substances, the following GHGs are subject for regulation under this act: chlorofluorocarbon, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.

Key changes made under the CEPA 1999 are as follows:
• Implementation of pollution prevention
• Introduction of new procedures to investigate and assess toxicity of substances
• Introduction of new procedures to set new requirements and controls for substances that the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health have determined to be toxic or capable of becoming toxic
• New provisions on animate products of biotechnology
• New provisions on fuels, international air and water pollution, motor emissions, release of nutrients into water that may cause excessive growth of aquatic vegetation and environmental emergencies
• New provisions to regulate the environmental impacts on government operations and to protect the environment on and in relation to federal land and aboriginal land
• New provisions on disposal of wastes
• New provisions on export and import of wastes
• Provision of new powers for enforcement officers and analysts appointed by the Minister of the Environment
• Specify criteria for courts to impose a sentence on an offender
• Encourage participation of citizens in making decisions on environmental matters: new rights to send written comments or notices of objection to the Minister of the Environment

This was later amended by the Bill C-33 (26 June 2008) to include period and comprehensive reviews of the environmental and economic impacts of biofuel production in Canada. This amendment bill is also known as Biofuel Bill, as it established a framework within which the government can regulate biofuels content. This includes the tracking of exports to make accurate calculations of the volume of renewable fuels as a percentage of the total fuel used in Canada, and the lifting of administrative burdens that would be placed on small producers and importers. The Biofuel Bill allows the federal government to implement regulations requiring 5% average renewable content in gasoline by 2010. Subsequent regulations will also require 2% average renewable content in diesel and heating oil by 2012 on successful demonstration of renewable diesel fuel use under the range of Canadian environmental conditions.

In addition, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, has been regulating sections of the Environmental Protection Act which directly address climate change and the emission of GHG, including:
• Passenger Automobile and Light Truck GHG Emissions Regulations (2010), which establishes GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2011-2016, and the new Regulations for Passenger Automobile and Light Truck GHG Emissions (2012), which establishes GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks of model years 2017 and beyond.
• Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (2012), which sets performance standards for carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electricity generation units.
• Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine GHG Emissions Regulations (2013), which establishes GHG emission standards for on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines (e.g. buses, tractors and refuse trucks).

It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources.

As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country’s ‘exploitable, but as yet unrealised’ hydropower ‘potential’. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region. If realised, this figure would amount to more than a doubling of the total installed national electricity generation capacity in Brazil – 121GW in 2012 (from all generation sources).
 
The PNE provides for the expansion of the electricity sector by 2030 with the use of energy sources: (1) Renewables - 191.35GW (92GW existed in 2010), (2) Conventional thermoelectric - 21.5GW (16GW existed in2010), and (3) Nuclear- 8GW (2GW existed in 2010).

The expressed objective of the law is to “establish the vision and fundamentals of integral development in harmony and balance with Mother Earth to Live Well, guaranteeing the continued capacity of Mother Earth to regenerate natural systems, recuperating and strengthening local and ancestral practices, within the framework of rights, obligations and responsibilities”. 

In relation to climate change the law has many provisions that outline the state’s vision, citizens’ rights, and responsibilities. It embraces the concept of “climate justice”, defined by the ability of all Bolivian citizens to “Live Well”, especially those who are most vulnerable to climate change. It reinforces the point that some states have more of a global responsibility to respond to climate change.

To encourage sustainable development of natural resources, it states that climate change trajectories should be accounted for when planning and zoning responsible land use.

The law focuses on reducing the risks posed by climate change through six lines of actions: 
• The permanent incorporation of prevention of and managed response to natural disasters into the System of Integral Planning 
• Risk management for the agricultural sector to prevent diminished crop yields and food insecurity
• The adoption of risk management of disasters as well as adaption to climate change across state development projects; development of informational networks to issue early warnings in times of natural crisis as well as to assist the agricultural industry and indigenous communities plan according to climate conditions
• Strengthening territorial management processes of sub-national governments through the incorporation of risk management and adaption to climate change perspectives 
• Articulation between public and private scientific research sectors to share knowledge and co-ordinate research regarding vulnerabilities related to climate change

The Law defines “Living Well” in relation to climate change and lays out the state’s legal obligations. The state will develop policies, strategies and legal techniques to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to them through strengthening institutional capacities for the monitoring of climate with the purpose of long-term planning. The state will also encourage the recuperation of traditional indigenous practices that were historically sustainable and allowed for the natural regeneration of resources.

The law also establishes the Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth, within the Ministry of Environment and Water, as the state entity responsible for much of the development, overseeing and co-ordination of projects, programmes and research as it relates to climate change and the objectives of the Plurinational Plan for Climate Change. It also co-ordinates scientific monitoring of GHG emissions. The entity will operate within the framework of “climate justice,” following the principles of Bolivia’s climate change politics. 

The Authority will operate through three mechanisms: (1) Joint Mechanism of Mitigation and Adaptation for the Integral and Sustainable Management of Mother Earth’s Forests; (2) Mitigation Mechanism to “Living Well”; and (3) Adaptation Mechanism to “Living Well”.

The Authority is also responsible for the management of the Plurinational Fund of Mother Earth. The Fund will be financed with multilateral and bilateral aid, public money from the national government allocated to mitigation or adaptation, funds from private donors, national or international loans, and funds at the disposal of the executive branch.

The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity. These aim at accommodating the 48,000 applications that were received since 2010. 

The 2000 CO2 Act focused on meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitment of overall GHG emission reductions of 8% in the 2008 – 2012 period compared to the 1990 base line. The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland’s GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000. 
Those include:
- CO2 levy for thermal fuels
- Climate cent on transportation fuels
- Voluntary commitments
- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration
- Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms
- Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020."

"Climate Change Act",2015,"United Kingdom",1755,GBR,Mitigation,Legislative,2008,"26 November 2008","Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation, Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target of at least an 80% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, against a 1990 baseline. It also creates 5-yearly “carbon budgets” as a pathway to meet the long-term target.

The Act establishes a legally binding target of at least an 80% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions.

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) – a new independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets – submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008–2012, 2013–2017 and 2018–2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023–2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period).

The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period – for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set. The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation – the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme.

The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste.

The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS.

The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks.

The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government’s adaptation work.

******

The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK’s global commitments.

The recommended budget and its latest progress report, the CCC (Committee on Climate Change) listed some recommendations in the form of priorities for policy development, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Enabling mature low carbon energy sources (e.g. onshore wind) to come to market</li>
 	<li>Defining how energy efficiency improvements shall be financed and delivered</li>
 	<li>Increasing adoption of low carbon heat, which includes policies to overcoming behavioural barriers</li>
 	<li>Extending vehicle efficiency targets through the 2020s, coupled with policies to increase use of electric vehicles</li>
 	<li>In order to decarbonise effectively by 2050, the CCC has called for all new investment from 2020 onwards in power to be low carbon, excluding back-up and balancing plant. From 2035 onwards, the same will apply to all investments in transport and head.</li>

Section 2 of this Act provided for it to come into force at later dates by Order in Council.","Carbon Pricing, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The Climate Change Response Act 2002 established an institutional and legal framework for New Zealand to ratify and meet its obligations and the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To this end, the Act authorised the Minister of Finance to manage New Zealand’s holdings of units for GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and to trade them on international carbon markets. Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times:
 
The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS. The intent is to remove the opportunity to arbitrage units by registering and deregistering the same piece of post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS multiple times.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.

The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2011 made several changes to the administrative functions of the Climate Change Response Act 2002, such as the functions of the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Authority, the appointment of enforcement officers, and the obligation to maintain confidentiality.

The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 made several important changes aimed at modifying New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme, including delaying the participation of the agriculture sector in the NZ ETS until 1 January 2015, and that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to the agriculture sector on an intensity basis. They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector’s participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to introduce a GHG emissions trading scheme in New Zealand (known as the NZ ETS). The Department of Inland Revenue specifies how the Climate Change Response Act amends the Income Tax Act 2004, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to cover the income tax consequences to the forestry sector and the GST consequences to all sectors of transactions in emissions units.

The Climate Change Response Amendment Act 2006 made numerous small changes to the 2002 Climate Change Response Act such as identifying an expiry period for both temporary and long-term certified emission reduction units, allowing the Governor General to make regulations establishing forest sink covenants, and adding principles of cost recovery such as via levies or fees.

St. 21 (2011-2012)”. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities.  Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
• Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
• Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
• Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
• Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
• Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
• Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
• Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%; 
• Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
• In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
• Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
• By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)

While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.

It meets international standards by maintaining the voluntary nature of accounting for draining and rewetting of wetlands, but goes beyond the UNFCCC decision by making accounting for cropland and grassland management mandatory for member states.
The new rules are intended to better recognise the efforts of farmers and forest owners to maintain carbon stored in soils and forests and to facilitate a more climate-friendly architecture (funds are available through the Common Agricultural Policy’s Rural Development pillar), protecting water resources and biodiversity.
It also contains reporting requirements for Member States on their initiatives to decrease emissions from forestry and agriculture-related activities as well as increase the carbon sink.

Its aim is “to ensure a climate-resilient and climate-compatible economy while achieving sustainable development and equitable low-carbon economic growth for Ghana”. It acknowledges that economic modernisation will increase emissions but argues that the new development path will reduce emissions against the BAU baseline through energy waste reduction, better infrastructure and improved public transport.

The NCCP’s emphasis is on climate resilient development pathway as well as on low carbon growth. It proposes to integrate traditional knowledge with the current and emerging knowledge to tackle climate change. It proposes the establishment of a dedicated climate change research centre.

It outlines five priority areas to improve food security, to increase infrastructure and communities’ resilience, to improve environmental management practices and ecosystems for greater biodiversity, to improve economic growth. Five unique focus areas are: 
• Agriculture and food security
• Disaster preparedness and response 
• Natural resource management
• Equitable social development
• Energy, industrial and infrastructural development

The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation is the main monitoring the implementation agency. It proposes to establish a secretariat of appropriate technical and professional competence. Further, The National Environmental and Natural Resources Council, chaired by the Vice President, will also have an oversight.

The Plan includes both situation analysis and strategic considerations as its base, and details of actions to be taken on three areas (adaptation, mitigation and capacity-building) and the entities responsible for delivery.

The analysis takes into account climate change science in Chile and abroad, the country’s vulnerability and the actions needed for adaptation. It includes GHG emissions from the energy sector, advances in analysing emission scenarios and mitigation potential. It also delves into the country’s capacity to design and implement policies, strategies and actions for adaptation and for mitigating emissions from legal, institutional and public policy perspectives. It further assesses national capacities for participating in international negotiations, meetings and reviews of IPCC reports, international and national co-operation initiatives on climate change, clean development mechanisms, and the carbon offset market, among others. 

The main adaptation actions proposed are: generating local climate scenarios, determining the impacts of climate change and the corresponding adaptation measures and formulating national and sector-based plans for adaptation to climate change. Specifically, the Plan affirms the need to determine impacts on water resources, biodiversity, the forestry, agriculture and livestock sectors, hydropower generation, infrastructure, coastal zones, fishery resources and public health.

The Plan calls for a national programme and sector-based plans for mitigating GHGs. The actions proposed include: designing a system to update GHG inventories; assessing the total and sector-specific potential for reducing GHGs; preparing indicators to monitor the impact of actions taken; preparing GHG mitigation plans, policies and strategies and generating miti¬ga¬tion scenarios for different timeframes.

The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability.

All relevant ministries, departments and agencies will have to devise their own plans and programmes to implement policy provisions relating to their sectors. Similarly, the lower levels of government, provincial governments; the regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan; federally administrated territories and local governments are expected to establish their own strategies, plans and programmes for NCCP implementation."

"National Climate Change Strategy",2015,Singapore,1619,SGP,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Executive,2012,"14 June 2012","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Transportation, Adaptation, Research and development","The National Climate Change Strategy 2012 (replacing a previous version published in 2008), produced by the National Climate Change Secretariat, provides a comprehensive overview of Singapore’s response to climate change. It reiterates the country’s pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.

The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country’s commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore’s long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore’s position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore’s response to climate change:
– Long-term and integrated planning;
– Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and
– Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.

It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:
– Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;
– Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;
– Harnessing green growth opportunities; and 
– Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies). 

The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore’s national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.  In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country’s core strategy (given the country’s limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:
– Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;
– Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;
– Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;
– Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;
– Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and
– Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.

The strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model. Finally, it outlines the various local and international partnerships (e.g. with other countries/cities) that Singapore is engaged in. "
"National Climate Change Response Policy White Paper (NCCRP)",2015,"South Africa",1643,ZAF,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Executive,2011,"Approved by cabinet on 18 October 2011","Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Transportation, Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The National Climate Change Response Policy is a comprehensive plan to address both mitigation and adaptation in the short, medium and long term (up to 2050). GHG emissions are set to stop increasing at the latest by 2020–2025, to stabilise for up to 10 years and then to decline in absolute terms.

Strategies are specified for the following areas:
– Carbon Pricing 
– Water 
– Agriculture and commercial forestry 
– Health 
– Biodiversity and ecosystems 
– Human settlements 
– Disaster risk reduction and management

The policy has two main objectives: first, to manage inevitable climate change impacts through interventions that build and sustain social, economic and environmental resilience and emergency response capacity. Secondly, to make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. 

The Policy specifies strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, making use of the short-, medium- and long-term planning horizons (up to five years from publication of policy, up to 20 years, up to 2050, respectively). The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years. 

Concerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a “carbon budgets” approach. It also proposed the deployment of a range of economic instruments, including the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies or entities where a carbon budget approach has been selected.

Energy Efficiency and Energy and Demand Management flagship programmes cover development and facilitation of an aggressive energy efficiency programme in industry, building on previous Demand Side Management programmes, and covering non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured programme will be established with appropriate initiatives, incentives and regulation, along with a well-resourced information collection and dissemination process. Local governments are encouraged to take an active part in demand-side management.

There is a short-term transportation flagship programme, which aims to facilitate the development of an enhanced public transportation programme to promote lower-carbon mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet by 2020. The planned rail recapitalisation programme is considered an important component of this Flagship Programme due to its projected contribution to modal shifts of passengers and freight. The programme further introduces a Government Vehicle Efficiency Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of the government vehicle fleet by 2020, by setting procurement objectives for efficient technology vehicles such as electric vehicles.

In the medium term, the plan calls for significant up-scaling of energy efficiency applications in transportation; and for promoting transport-related interventions including transportation modal shifts (road to rail, private to public transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g. electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels.

The principles of the White Paper include prioritising co-operation and the promotion of research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation, lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies, practices and processes for employment by existing or new sectors or sub-sectors. All fields and flagship programmes include a key element of research and development, data collection and analysis tools in their respective areas.

Adaptation efforts are prioritised, acknowledging the vulnerability of the country. Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management.

In order to monitor success of measures, South Africa will, within two years of the publication of the policy, design and publish a draft Climate Change Response Measurement and Evaluation System."

The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited). 

The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector. 

Targets outlined in this legislation include: 
- 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
- 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
- 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)
- 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector 
- by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating
- by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels
- by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden."
"National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation",2015,Tajikistan,1699,TJK,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Executive,2003,"06 June 2003","Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Adaptation, Research and development","The National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation was approved and adopted by the Governmental Decree No.259. The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.

The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.

To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.

Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection."

"National Climate Change Policy",2015,Uganda,1731,UGA,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Executive,2013,"19 December 2013","REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation, Adaptation","As the document outlines, “the goal of the policy is to ensure a harmonised and co-ordinated approach towards a climate- resilient and low-carbon development path for sustainable development in Uganda”. The policy notes that the level of knowledge on climate change and its impacts remains low in Uganda. Therefore, it seeks to raise awareness of climate change, targeting sectorial weaknesses (to be determined by different governmental agencies and ministries) in the short term but providing information for a wide variety of stakeholders in the long term.
To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building. 
The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables. 
The adoption of climate change strategies that address the impact of climate change and promote sustainable activities in the sectors of agriculture and livestock, fishery production, water management, forestry, wetland, biodiversity and ecosystem services and tourism are identified are important needs to develop Uganda’s approach to adaption to climate change.
Moreover, the Policy also seeks to implement the basic institutional structure required to finance this awareness raising campaign and to develop a performance measurement framework for each ministry and agency involved. The policy also strengthens the Climate Change Unit, upgrading it to a National Climate Change Commission with a more advanced legal and institutional framework that can co-ordinate climate change policy across sectors and regions. The Policy Committee on Environment is also strengthened to help guide climate change policy implementation.
As annex to the Climate Change Policy, the Cost Implementation Strategy provides a more detailed account on the implementation of the Policy, including an indicative costing for the programmes and activities to be developed. Thus, according to the document, the total cost for the implementation of the Climate Change Policy is estimated in approximately 3.9 billion dollars over a 15-year period."

The Strategy requires that the government: (i) elaborates GHG inventories and reports about their impact on the environment and on public health; (ii) adopts programmes and projects to mitigate the effects of climate change; (iii) promotes technical/professional awareness; (iv) fosters international cooperation, particularly transfer of knowledge and experiences; (v) promotes the use of clean technologies; (vi) implement the Convention‘s and the Protocol‘s commitments; (vii) creates a structure and appropriate instruments for the management of Kyoto Protocol‘s flexible mechanisms. Out of these activities, Angola submitted its Initial National Communication to UNFCCC in 2012. The communication contains the national GHG inventory. The GHG inventory comprises the following sectors: energy, industrial processes, agriculture, forestry, land use and waste. The government also established a Designated National Authority in 2009. Beyond that, education, awareness rising and investigation actions are being conducted. The Action Plan, which should have followed the approval of the strategy, was not prepared.

The National Strategy discusses the possibilities and opportunities that Angola has as a result of joining the Kyoto Protocol as well as the flexible mechanisms that can be used, especially in the case of Angola, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). 

The Resolution sets the intervention framework for Angola in the legislative, technical and human domains. This framework should contribute to the stabilisation of GHG emissions and technological development of the country. The National Implementation Strategy comprises: generating reports and inventories about GHG emissions in Angola and their impact on the environment and public health; producing programmes and projects with measures to mitigate the effects of climate change; developing technical and professional training actions in areas related to climate change; fostering international co-operation within the context of climate change, particularly in terms of transfer of knowledge, experience and technology; and instituting the Designated National Authority (DNA) under the Ministry of the Environment as the entity responsible for coordinating inter-sectoral efforts for the implementation of UNFCCC in the country on the issues related to CDM.

• Agriculture: Improving crop and livestock production practices for higher food security and farmer income while reducing emissions
• Deforestation: Reducing emissions by protecting and re-establishing forests for their economic and ecosystem services including as carbon stocks
• Power: expanding electricity generation from renewable energy for domestic and regional markets
• Transportation, industrial sectors and buildings: Leapfrogging to modern and energy efficient technologies

The strategy targets climate change mitigation and adaptation. It sets a target to limit 2030 emissions to 150 Mt CO2e (level of 2010 emissions), approximately 250 Mt CO2e less than in the business as usual scenario. It also establishes a target to increase generating capacity by 25,000MW by 2030 – hydro 22,000MW, geothermal 1,000MW and wind 2,000MW. There are programmes to replace wood fuel for domestic use with less polluting fuels, such as biogas. There are plans to distribute 9m stoves by 2015 and 34m by 2030.

The initiative establishes a national financial mechanism called the “CRGE Facility” to mobilise, access, sequence and blend domestic and international, public and private sources of finance to support the institutional building and implementation of the strategy.

The CRGE initially relies on existing institutions, notably the Environmental Protection Authority (which in 2013 was replaced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest), the Ethiopian Development Research Institute, six ministries, and several government agencies. Subsequent phases will strengthen institutions to implement the strategy.

Summary The EPACC calls for the mainstreaming of climate change into decision-making at a national level and emphasises planning and implementation monitoring. It identifies 20 climate change risks, mainly in the following areas: health risks (human and animal); agriculture production decline; land degradation; water shortages; biodiversity; waste; displacement; distributive justice. The EPACC also identifies institutions responsible for mitigating these risks. Specific adaptation objectives include:
• Reducing impacts of droughts by cloud seeding to induce rain
• Establishing building and construction codes that ensure structures withstand extreme weather events
• Storing food and feed in good years for use in bad years
• Ensuring transportation access to disaster prone areas
• Developing insurance schemes for weather damage compensation
• Organising local communities for quick response to extreme weather events
• Preparing to cater for refugees driven out of their homes by climate change
• Mapping and delineating areas likely to suffer from climate change and extreme weather events
• Developing an accessible information network on climate change
• Developing an early warning system to alert people of impending extreme weather events"

• Fruits and vegetables 
• Aquaculture
• Sustainable forestry and wood processing, 
• Business process outsourcing, 
• Eco-tourism 
• Bio-ethanol 
Sustainably growing the extractive and forestry sectors
This includes:
• Improving the regulatory environment for forestry,
• Transition to more value-added production of timber including the integration of primary and secondary production; 
• Increased efficiency in extraction, reduction of waste and increased recovery in timber processing. 
Since the mining sector is such an important contributor to Guyana's economy, (c.20% GDP), and employment, mining is not required to cease under the terms of the LCDS. A Special Land Use Committee was established in 2010 which proposed the following projects: 
• Strengthening Land Use Planning and Co-ordination among natural resource agencies
• Sustainable Land Management in the mining and forestry sectors
• Enhanced Land Reclamation 
• Improved Infrastructure in Mining Districts

"National Action Plan on Climate Change",2015,India,1320,IND,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Executive,2008,2008,"Energy Supply, Energy Demand, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation, Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) outlines existing and future policies and programmes directed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
These National Missions will be institutionalised by respective ministries and will be organised through inter-sectoral groups that include, in addition to related Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission, experts from industry, acade¬mia and civil society. The institutional structure will vary depending on the task to be addressed and will include the oppor¬tunity to compete on the best management model.

The Nodal Ministry for each Mission has been tasked to evolve specif¬ic objectives spanning the remaining years of the 11th Plan and the 12th Plan period 2012–2013 to 2016¬–2017. Appropriate indicators and methodologies will be developed to assess both avoided emissions and adaptation benefits.

The NAPCC recommends a minimum share of renewable energy in the national grid of 5% in 2010, subsequently to be increased by 1% every year to reach 15% by 2020.

Energy Supply is dealt with through the National Solar Mission, which aims to make solar electricity cost-competitive with coal power and increase the share of solar energy in the energy mix by developing new solar technologies, both photovoltaic and solar thermal. The Mission recommends implementation in three stages, leading to an installed capacity of 20,000 MW by the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan in 2022. It also sets the objective of establishing a solar research centre, increased international collaboration on technology development, strength¬ening of domestic manufacturing capacity and increased government funding and international support.
The Indian Solar Mission is a large-scale solar energy programme that will run from 2010 to 2022. Given the major policy focus of the Indian government to provide wider energy access in rural areas, the project promotes electricity generation from both small- and large-scale solar plants. The plan’s long-term aim is to make solar energy competitive with fossil-based energy.
The Solar Roadmap establishes specific installed capacity targets for three different periods of three and four years. It sets specific goals for increasing use of solar thermal technologies in urban areas, industry and commercial establishments.
Under Phase One of the National Solar Mission, a reverse auction mechanism and rapidly falling solar PV module prices brought down the delivered cost of electricity from solar PV by more than half in three years.

Under Phase Two of the Solar Mission, a capital subsidy in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) allows project developers to finance their projects and sell electricity at the fixed price.

In January 2008, the federal minister responsible for renewable energy announced that the Indian government would provide a subsidy for solar power plants to help develop renewable energy infrastructure. The subsidy consisted of INR12 (USD0.19) per kWh for solar photovoltaic power and INR10 (USD0.16) per kWh for solar thermal power fed to the electricity grid. A maximum capacity of 10MW from each Indian state and 5MW per developer was eligible under the scheme. Investors were not eligible. Developers sell electricity to state-run utilities and the incentives are paid to them based on the tariff the utilities provide. The incentives, for a period of 10 years, are over and above any financial assistance provided by the states. 

The power tariff for projects under phase two has been fixed as INR5.45 (USD0.09) per kWh. Half of the projects in Phase Two will have domestic content and be technology neutral.

The government has also made available following incentives for solar power 
• Import of plant and machinery for the construction of solar power projects is exempted from Additional Custom Duty and the total custom duty has come down from 9.35% to 5.15%
• Goods required for manufacturing of solar cells and modules have been exempted from Additional Custom Duty and the total custom duty has come down to 9.35%
• Excise duty exemption for all machinery required to set up a solar power generation project or facility
• Basic customs duty on solar lantern/lamps has been reduced from 10% to 5%

The Solar Mission also stimulates national R&D by providing innovation subsidies and scholarships to at least 1,000 young scientists and engineers, and by launching specific pilot projects aligned with the Mission’s targets. 

Key targets of the National Solar Mission:
• To create an enabling policy framework for the deployment of 20GW of solar power by 2022
• To ramp up utility grid-connected solar power including rooftop generation to 1,100MW  by 2013, 10, 000MW by 2017 and 20,000MW by 2022 through the mandatory use of the renewable purchase obligation by utilities backed with a preferential tariff
• To promote programmes for off-grid applications, reaching 1,000MW by 2017 and 2000MW by 2022
• To achieve 15m m2 solar thermal collector area by 2017 and 20m m2 by 2022
• To deploy 20m solar lighting systems for rural areas by 2022
• Phase Two of the National Solar Mission has a target of 9,000MW grid-connected and 800MW off-grid solar power by 2017

Energy demand is addressed via two programmes: 
The National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) is likely to achieve about 23m tons oil-equivalent of fuel savings in coal, gas, and petroleum products by 2014-15, along with an expected avoided capacity addition of over 19,000MW. The CO2 emission reduction is estimated to be 98.55m tons annually. Building on this, the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, a market-based mechanism, seeks to accelerate and incentivise energy efficiency in the large energy-intensive industries and envisages energy saving of 6.6m toe by 2014-15. 

National Mission on Sustainable Habitat: The Plan seeks to promote energy efficiency as an essential component of urban planning. It calls for extending the Energy Conservation Building Code, and emphasises urban waste management and recycling, including power production from waste. 
REDD+ and LULUCF aspects of the climate action plan are addressed through the National Mission for a Green India, which sets the following targets for 2022. Increased forest/tree cover on 5m ha of forest/non-forest lands and improved quality of forest cover on another 5m ha of non-forest/ forest lands (a total of 10m ha); Improved ecosystem services including biodiversity, hydrological services, carbon sequestration from the 10m ha of forest/non-forest lands mentioned above; Increased forest-based livelihood income of about 3m households, living in and around the forests; Enhanced annual CO2 sequestration by 50m to 60m tonnes in the year 2022.
The plan also calls for stronger enforcement of automotive fuel economy standards, using pricing measures to encourage the purchase of efficient vehicles, and providing incentives for the use of public transportation.

The National Mission on Strategic Knowledge of Climate Change calls for the establishment of a Climate Science Research Fund, improved climate modelling capacities and increased international collaboration.

Other missions include the National Water Mission to improve efficiency in water use by 20% through pricing and other measures; the National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, with targets for biodiversity, forest cover and other ecological conservation in the Himalayan region; and the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, supporting adaptation to climate change in agriculture by developing climate-resilient crops and adapting agricultural practices, as well as the expansion of weather insurance mechanisms.

The Plan aims to put Jamaica in a position to achieve developed country status by 2030 and in the process, make it: “… the place of choice to live, work, raise families, and do business”.

This is Jamaica’s first long-term national development plan and covers a 21-year period. It provides a framework to ensure that the management of natural hazards, which are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under climate change, is integrated into Jamaica’s development and that hazard considerations are systematically incorporated into development policy.

Vision 2030 Jamaica has four national goals, aligned to 15 National Outcomes. Following from the national outcomes are 82 National Strategies, with sector strategies and actions. Climate change is positioned under the goal of Jamaica having a healthy natural environment. Another goal is “Hazard Risk Reduction and adaptation to climate change”. There are four specific National Strategies here:
• Improve resilience to all forms of hazards
• Develop measures to adapt to climate change
• Contribute to the effort to reduce the global rate of climate change
• Improve emergency response capability

There is also a sector plan on Climate Change, whose National Strategies include diversification of the energy supply and the promotion of energy efficiency and conservation. The Vision sees this as a “win-win” opportunity, reducing spending on imported oil, pollution and pollution-related illness. Finally, reforestation efforts are seen as a means to mitigate climate change and improve watersheds and reduce landslides and erosion.

• To achieve a pro-active, climate risk resilient Jordan; remaining a low-carbon growing economy, sustainable water and agricultural resources, healthy ecosystems and climate resilient communities
• To build adaptive capacity of communities and institutions, including social issues related to gender and vulnerable groups, increasing resiliency of ecosystems to climate change, especially as it relates to water resources and agriculture; taking full advantages of any mitigation opportunities
• To prioritise both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, but with emphasis on adaptation [given Jordan’s relatively low carbon emissions

The strategy lists seven short-term goals. 
• Provide guidance to government ministries in order to implement policy related to climate change adaptation and mitigation
• Facilitate the incorporation of climate change adaptation and mitigation into various private and public sectors, policies and legal frameworks
• Encourage strategies maximising co-benefits as it relates to health and minimising unintended negative consequences
• Encourage the integration of climate change mitigation objectives into key sectors’ policies (energy, transportation and waste)
• Take note of the needs of vulnerable groups while devising adaptation and mitigation policies, and incorporating adaptation and mitigation into green growth strategies and other policies as they relate to vulnerable groups (youth, elderly, women, poor)
• Mainstream climate change considerations in infrastructure and land-use planning and services
• Provide a strategy to ensure adequate financing for mitigation and adaptation objectives, strengthening institutional and human resource capacity

The Strategy document overviews the country’s strategies to combat climate change across various sectors and delineates the strategic actions that the country will implement in the coming years. Special attention is given to “vulnerable groups” that stand to disproportionately suffer from the negative effects of climate change, as well as strategies to address gender imbalances between men and women. The document also details how the Climate Change Strategy will be monitored from a policy implementation perspective as well as institutional arrangements that will encourage adoption of climate change perspective in ministries outside of those directly involved with environmental management.

"General Law on Climate Change",2015,Mexico,1449,MEX,"Mitigation and Adaptation",Legislative,2012,"6 June 2012 (last amended on 07/05/2014)","Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation, Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The approval of the GLCC gives certainty and continuity to climate policy in Mexico and sets the country on a path to a low carbon economy. It establishes the basis for the creation of institutions, legal frameworks and financing to move towards a low carbon economy. As a General Law, it specifies the different responsibilities of the Federation, Mexico’s pledge under the Copenhagen Accord, in terms of committing the country to an emissions reduction target of 30% below Business As Usual (BAU) by 2020, subject to the availability of financial resources and technology transfer, as well as 50% GHG emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 2000.

The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities.

Taking into account Mexico’s vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the “Risk Atlas” which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios. 

The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors – energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes.

The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner. 

The National Climate Change Policy, the Special Programme on Climate Change, and the Special Programme on the Use of Renewable Energy lay down details for the implementation of the Law.

It consolidates within the Department for the Environment a number of initiatives related to climate change established by other ministries. It presents a summary of current emissions and projections of climate impacts, and it integrates the plans of individual ministries.

The Plan includes a summary of current emissions and projections of climate impacts. The mitigation measures draw upon the 2008 National Energy Strategy and are mainly related to energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy. They comprise seven areas: energy demand and supply, transportation, industry, waste management, agriculture, forestry and construction. In order to promote mitigation measures, the Department for the Environment should: promote CDM projects; elaborate GHG inventories, particularly aiming at establishing carbon pricing; and establish green taxes for electric equipment and energy efficiency improvement in existing buildings. 

Adaptation measures are proposed within the areas of weather forecast, water resources, agriculture, forestry, desertification, fisheries, public health, and tourism.

The National Plan against Climate Change establishes a number of research initiatives to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation. These include creating a human and technical apparatus to allow the identification, monitoring and alert of extreme climate events; promoting research on climate variation and climate change prediction; preparing climate risk assessments on regional and local levels; helping different sectors to evaluate their vulnerabilities to climate change; and elaborating climate change adaptation strategies.

Other objectives are to reduce socio-economic and environmental impact of climate change, and promote sustainable development and environmental protection through actions of mitigation and adaptation. NCCS is divided into a national and an international agenda, detailing specific areas and actions to be taken within each domain.

The national agenda entails two core areas, mitigation and adaptation, as well as four transversal issues: measurement; capability development and technological transfer; public awareness, education and cultural exchange; and financing. 

The mitigation strategy is structured around three main action areas. The first, reduction of GHG emissions by sources, aims to identify emission sources and develop opportunities for reductions in eight sectors: energy; industry; transportation; land use change; tourism; agriculture and livestock; solid waste; and water resources. The second area of action addresses carbon sequestration in forests and reforestation. Complementing the scheme on mitigation, the third area refers to emission compensation (carbon markets) and encompasses the development of local markets; national programmes for compensation payments; voluntary markets; and participation in international schemes, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). 

The adaptation strategy aims to reduce sectoral and geographic vulnerability to climate change, focusing on six areas: agriculture and livestock; infrastructure; health; coastal areas and biodiversity; water resources; and fishery.

"National Plan for Climate Change Adaptation",2015,Colombia,1117,COL,Adaptation,Executive,2012,"31 August 2012","Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The National Plan for Climate Change Adaptation’s objectives are to increase knowledge of the potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change and climate variability, to incorporate climate risk management in territorial and sectoral planning and to mitigate the climate change vulnerability of ecological and socio-economic systems. It promotes a planned, territorial environmental development compatible to Climate Change variability through sort, medium and long term actions. 

This Plan seeks the mainstreaming of climate variables and projections into environmental, territorial and sectoral planning, effectively decreasing the vulnerability of populations, ecosystems and productive sectors, and increasing the social, economic and ecosystems capacities to answer to climate events. The plan needs to be an instrument to establish strategic guidelines and bring effective tools to prioritise adaptations measures, as well as to guide sectors and territories in the development of strategies and adaptation plans to reduce their vulnerability and associated risks.

The implementation of the plan is divided into four phases. Beginning in 2012, the first two stages were conceptual and methodological, followed by the detailing of specific sectoral and regional plans. Phase four, implementation of measures, began in 2013, while monitoring and reporting, the final phase, began in 2014.

"Danish strategy for adaptation to a changing climate (2008) and the Action Plan for a climate-proof Denmark (2012)",2015,Denmark,1160,DNK,Adaptation,Executive,2008,2008,"Adaptation, Research and development, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The Danish strategy for adaptation to a changing climate aims to assist authorities, enterprises and individuals in “reacting to the consequences of climate change in good time on their own initiative”. The Strategy thus calls for development and implementation of information campaigns (including a web portal for climate change adaptation) and measures to facilitate the consideration of climate change issues in planning and development. In addition, the strategy provides a broad vulnerability assessment of specific sectors, in particular coastal management, construction, energy supply, water supply, agriculture and forestry, fisheries, nature management, land use planning, human health, rescue preparedness, and insurance related aspects.

The Action Plan for a Climate-Proof Denmark (2012) then provides an overview of initiatives planned or already launched by the government. The main focus areas of the plan (following text adapted directly from the Action Plan document): an improved framework for climate change adaptation; more consultancy and a new knowledge base; strengthened collaboration and coordination; green transition; international climate change adaptation.

"Egypt&#8217;s National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management",2015,Egypt,1177,EGY,Adaptation,Executive,2011,"December 2011","Adaptation, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","The overarching goal of this Strategy is to increase Egypt’s flexibility in dealing with climate change risks and disasters as well as the Egyptian Community’s “ability to absorb, contain, and reduce such risks and disasters” across different sectors.

The Strategy evaluates the current situation and risks across key sectors, in particular the intersection of coastal zones with water resources and irrigation, agriculture, health, urban areas, housing, roads, and tourism. It recommends (i) the integration of sector specific adaptation plans with each five-year plan and national development programmes; (ii) enhancing community participation and building a “Safety First” culture; (iii) promoting regional and international co-operation; and (iv) engaging in continuous monitoring of progress.

The Strategy identifies seven determinants of success in adapting to climate change risks: (i) political will at all levels, (ii) availability of human, financial, and natural resources, (iii) reform and adjustments of institutional frameworks, (iv) amendments to legislation and laws, (v) strengthening the National Information Exchange System, (vi) identification and monitoring, assessment, and follow-up of performance indicators, and (vii) development of a national model for social and economic analysis and projections.

The specific framework for adaptation outlined in this Strategy is divided into four phases of execution consisting of four five-year plans. Key proposed operational measures for the first five-year plan include: developing a GIS monitoring database on coastal zones, developing a Regional Climate Model (RCM), studying the effectiveness of natural protection systems such as dunes, formulating national legislation to enable climate change risk reduction, developing additional regulations for coastal development, and enhancing partnerships between the public and private sector.

Further outlines total estimated investment costs over 20 years by sector and specific operational measure. The total estimated cost across all sectors is calculated to be EGP53.07bn (USD7.4bn)."
"2030 framework for climate and energy policies (strategic document)",2015,EU,1196,EUR,Mitigation,Legislative,2014,"28 October 2014 (endorsement by the European Council, binding legislation to be drafted)","Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","To ensure that the EU is on the cost-effective track towards meeting its objective of cutting emissions by at least 80% by 2050, the Commission proposed the ‘2030 framework for climate change and energy policies’. It was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 as a strategic document, although binding legislation is yet to be drafted. It includes the binding 2030 EU domestic GHG reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990, as well as a target of at least 27% for final renewable energy, and a at least 27% for energy savings by 2030 (target to be reviewed upwards to 30% in 2020).
In addition, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. To achieve the 2030 binding 40% reduction target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005. In parallel, emissions from non-EU ETS sectors would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, through national measures. To address the surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to improve the system's resilience, a market stability reserve is to be established and the annual factor to reduce the cap on the maximum permitted emissions is to be changed from the current 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021. The volume of free allowances is to be reduced progressively; Member States with a GDP per capita below 60% of the EU average may opt to continue to give free allowances to the energy sector up to 2030, but the maximum amount handed out for free after 2020 should be no more than 40% of the allowances allocated to eligible Member States.
The 2030 Framework stresses the importance of a fully functioning and connected EU energy market, as foreseen in the European Energy Security Strategy (2014). The Commission is to be supported by Member States to take measures to ensure achievement of a minimum target of 10% of electricity interconnections no later than 2020.

The 2030 framework also launches the preparation of the Energy Union aiming at affordable, secure and sustainable energy, by “pooling resources, connecting networks and uniting member states’ power when negotiating with non EU countries”. Specific legislative proposals are expected in 2015.

"2020 Climate and Energy Package (contains Directive 2009/29/EC,  Directive 2009/28/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC and Decision No. 406/2009/EC of the Parliament and the Council ; see below)",2015,EU,1204,EUR,Mitigation,Legislative,2009,2009,"Carbon Pricing, Energy Supply, Energy Demand, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation, Institutions / Administrative arrangements","In 2007 EU leaders endorsed an integrated approach to climate and energy policy that aims to combat climate change and increase energy security while strengthening its competitiveness. In 2008 the European Commission proposed binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. This “climate and energy package” became law in 2009. The core of the package comprises four pieces of complementary legislation.
The 20-20-20 targets include:
• Reduction of EU GHG emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 
• 20% of EU energy consumption to come from renewable resources by 2020 
• 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, by improving energy efficiency
The EU committed to increase its emissions reduction to 30% by 2020, on condition that other major emitting countries commit to do their fair share under a global climate agreement.
Member States will limit GHG emissions between 2013 and 2020 according to a linear trajectory with binding annual targets. This will ensure a gradual move towards the 2020 targets in sectors where changes take time to implement, such as buildings, infrastructure and transportation. To increase the cost-effectiveness of policies and measures, Member States are allowed to deviate from the linear trajectory to a certain degree.

The Renewable Energy Directive sets the following targets:
• At least 10% share of renewables in final energy consumption in the transportation sector by 2020
• The biofuels and bio-liquids should contribute to a reduction of at least 35% of GHG emissions in order to be recognised. From 2017, their share in emissions savings should be increased to 50 %
It further commissions an assessment of the inclusion of emissions and removals related to LULUCF – anticipated to follow up on any international agreement on forestry, deforestation and sustainability criteria.
